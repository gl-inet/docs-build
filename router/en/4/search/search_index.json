Why do I need to use my router to connect to a public hotspot? \u00b6 Public Wi-Fi is not safe We cannot put enough emphasis on how public Wi-Fi is not safe. By connecting your GL.iNet router to the public wifi, you can simply login to your VPN account directly through your router's Admin Panel, and it\u2019ll automatically encrypt all connected devices within the local network, saving you from the trouble of setting up VPN on every single device. Use as a repeater to allow connections with multiple devices Besides that, some public Wi-Fi such as hotel complimentary Wi-Fi are limited to let\u2019s say 2 devices. When you\u2019re travelling in a group, that\u2019s just not going to work. Instead, you could connect a travel router to the hotel Wi-Fi, and use it as a hotspot to broadcast Wi-Fi to all your devices including laptops, smartphones, tablets\u2026etc. The hotel Wi-Fi will only recognize the travel router as a single device, but you could enjoy the free Wi-Fi as many devices as you want. How do I connect my router to a public hotspot via captive portal? \u00b6 Connect your smartphone or computer to the router. Power on the router. On your smartphone or computer, connect WiFi to your travel router by searching its SSID, and enter the WiFi password. The default password indicated as \u201cWIFI Key\u201d on the bottom of your router. Access your travel router's web admin panel. After successfully connecting to your router, go to the web admin panel of your router by visiting router IP address (default is 192.168.8.1 ) on the Internet browser. If you are logging in for the first time, select a language and create a new password for the router's web admin panel. Connect your router to the public hotspot's SSID using the Repeater function. Fill out the hotel's Captive Portal. Troubleshooting \u00b6 However, you may find that you are unable to enter the captive portal, so you cannot connect to the hotspot or access the Internet. In this case, please try the following solutions one at a time. Solution 1: Change DNS settings \u00b6 Go to web Admin Panel -> NETWORK -> DNS. Then, make sure the DNS Rebinding Attack Protection is disable and the Mode is Automatic . Go to web Admin Panel -> VPN -> VPN Dashboard. Make sure the connection of OpenVPN and WireGuard client is disable. Go to web Admin Panel -> APPLICATIONS -> AdGuard Home. Make sure the AdGuard Home is stopped. Use your web browser to visit a webpage, it will be redirected to the captive portal of the hotspot automatically. If you are using smartphone but your web browser doesn't redirect to the captive portal. Please turn off the Wi-Fi of your smartphone and then turn it on and reconnect to the Wi-Fi of your router again. The captive portal should be popped up directly after you entered the Wi-Fi password. Solution 2\uff1aMAC Clone \u00b6 Sometimes, Solution 1 is not enough to solve this issue. Some hotels limit the number of devices each customer can access by MAC address, and they record the MAC address of your phone (or other device) when it first time accesses the hotel WiFi. In this case, we need to clone the MAC address that the your phone uses to connect to the hotel WiFi to the router. Got your smartphone registered on the network. Make sure your phone is connected to the hotel WiFi. Find the MAC address that your phone uses to connect to the hotel's WiFi. Here is an example for iPhone (iOS 16.1.2), go to settings -> Wi-Fi -> Select the hotel WiFi. You will find the Wi-Fi Address, write down this address. For some old phones, the MAC address is not found there in WiFi, then it uses the real MAC address of the phone. This can be found in the phone's Settings -> About where you can find the phone's MAC address. Use your phone or computer to connect to router, access web admin panel. On the left side of web Admin Panel -> NETWORK -> MAC Address. Select Manual Mode, fill in the MAC address you wrote down in step 2 into the input box and click Apply. It may need to reboot the router to take effect. Solution 3\uff1aAsk the help from the hotel staff \u00b6 Some hotel's network has a very strict verification policy. Neither solution 1 nor 2 is unable to make it work, then you can consult with the hotel staff if they can add the router's MAC address(the Factory default one) to their \"Whitelist\" directly.

You may not be able to access your router but you can re-install the firmware by using Uboot failsafe. Note: The Uboot operation will remove your router's settings and installed plugins. Please prepare a computer with an ethernet port, if not, please prepare an additional USB Ethernet Adapter. Please follow the procedures below to access the Uboot Web UI and re-install the firmware. You can also refer to video tutorial below. Please download firmware here to your computer. Some models, such as GL-AR750S-EXT, is available in two formats of firmware, please use the firmware for Uboot, its file name extension is .img . Remove the power of router. Connect your computer to the Ethernet port (either LAN or WAN) of the router. You MUST leave all the other ports unconnected . Press and hold the Reset button firmly, and then power up the router. If your router doesn't have a power button, plugging the power in will power it on automatically. Then you will see a LED flashing in a regular sequence a few times, please release your finger after the sequence changes. The following will give the description of sequence of each model of LED flashing. Note: Same router models with different manufacturing dates may have different LED colours or flashing sequences, it won't affect the UBoot process. Please pay more attention to the change of the flashing LED. For GL-MT3000(Beryl AX) , the blue LED flashes 6 times then turns white and stays on. For GL-MT2500/GL-MT2500A(Brume 2) , the blue LED flashes 5 times then turns white and stays on. For GL-S200 , the cyan LED flashes 5 times, then briefly turns purple, then turns cyan and stays on.

For GL-S1300(Convexa-S), GL-B1300(Convexa-B) , the LED flashes 4 times. The left most LED may stay on the whole time while the rightmost LED flashes 4 times, then the middle LED turns on and stays on. (For some old GL-B1300, the left most LED stays on the whole time, and both the middle LED and the rightmost LED flash 5 times simutaneously then they stays on.) For GL-SF1200 , the 5G LED flashes 5 times then stays on. For GL-AX1800(Flint) , the blue LED flashes 5 times then turns white and stays on.

Right click Local Area Connection -> Properties . Click Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) -> Properties . Set the IP adress to 192.168.1.2 manually. Set the Subnet mask to 255.255.255.0 . Click the OK button. Windows 11 Open Settings. Click on Network & Internet . Click the Ethernet tab. Under the \"IP assignment\" section, click the Edit button. Select the Manual option. Turn on the IPv4 toggle switch. Set the static IP address as 192.168.1.2 . Specify the Subnet mask as 255.255.255.0 . Click the Save button. macOS Click the Apple icon in the top left corner of the screen, and select System Preferences . Click Network . Click Ethernet on the left and then click the drop-down box next to Configure IPv4 and select Manually . If you are using a USB Ethernet Adapter, Ethernet may not be found and it may show up as the name of the USB Ethernet Adapter. Enter the IPv4 Address to 192.168.1.2 , Subnet Mask to 255.255.255.0 , Router to 192.168.1.1 , then click the Apply button in the lower right corner. Use browser to visit http://192.168.1.1 , this is the Uboot Web UI. Note: The Uboot Web UI above may not be exactly the same as what you see, because the Uboot version is different for different production dates. In some cases, we recommend upgrading the Uboot version. Please refer to the tutorial below. Upgrade the Uboot version Some Uboot versions are too old or its Web UI is not easy for users to understand, so we recommend upgrading the Uboot version. For example, the following figure shows the Web UI of the old Uboot version of GL-AR750S. It has two Choose file buttons, which can be confusing for users. You need to download the Uboot file here in advance. Repeat the above steps until you can access the Uboot Web UI. Use browser to visit http://192.168.1.1/uboot.html Click the Choose file button and choose the Uboot file you just downloaded. Click Update U-Boot button. It will take several minutes to update. After a successful update, it will reboot the router. At this time you can change the IP setting back in step 4 and try to access the web Admin Panel, if you can access the web Admin Panel normally, it means the router has been rebooted. Repeate the above steps to upgrade the firmware. If the Uboot version is updated successfully, you will see that the Uboot Web UI has changed at step 5. Click Choose file button to find the firmware file. Then click Update firmware button. Wait for around 3 minutes. Don\u2019t power off your device when updating.

You may not be able to access your router but you can re-install the firmware by using Uboot failsafe. Note: The Uboot operation will remove your router's settings and installed plugins. Please prepare a computer with an ethernet port, if not, please prepare an additional USB Ethernet Adapter. Please follow the procedures below to access the Uboot Web UI and re-install the firmware. You can also refer to video tutorial below. Please download firmware here to your computer. Some models, such as GL-AR750S-EXT, is available in two formats of firmware, please use the firmware for Uboot, its file name extension is .img . Remove the power of router. Connect your computer to the Ethernet port (either LAN or WAN) of the router. You MUST leave all the other ports unconnected . Press and hold the Reset button firmly, and then power up the router. If your router doesn't have a power button, plugging the power in will power it on automatically. Then you will see a LED flashing in a regular sequence a few times, please release your finger after the sequence changes. The following will give the description of sequence of each model of LED flashing. Note: Same router models with different manufacturing dates may have different LED colours or flashing sequences, it won't affect the UBoot process. Please pay more attention to the change of the flashing LED. For GL-MT3000(Beryl AX) , the blue LED flashes 6 times then turns white and stays on. For GL-MT2500/GL-MT2500A(Brume 2) , the blue LED flashes 5 times then turns white and stays on. For GL-S200 , the cyan LED flashes 5 times, then briefly turns purple, then turns cyan and stays on. For GL-A1300(Slate Plus) , the LED flashes slowly 5 times, then stays on for a short while, then flashes quickly all the time.

For GL-E750(Mudi) , its screen will first display \"Booting\", followed by \"Reset Counting 1 to 4\", and finally \"Please Open Web 192.168.1.1\". For GL-S1300(Convexa-S), GL-B1300(Convexa-B) , the LED flashes 4 times. The left most LED may stay on the whole time while the rightmost LED flashes 4 times, then the middle LED turns on and stays on. (For some old GL-B1300, the left most LED stays on the whole time, and both the middle LED and the rightmost LED flash 5 times simutaneously then they stays on.) For GL-SF1200 , the 5G LED flashes 5 times then stays on. For GL-AX1800(Flint) , the blue LED flashes 5 times then turns white and stays on.

Use browser to visit http://192.168.1.1 , this is the Uboot Web UI. Note: The Uboot Web UI above may not be exactly the same as what you see, because the Uboot version is different for different production dates. In some cases, we recommend upgrading the Uboot version. Please refer to the tutorial below. Upgrade the Uboot version Some Uboot versions are too old or its Web UI is not easy for users to understand, so we recommend upgrading the Uboot version. For example, the following figure shows the Web UI of the old Uboot version of GL-AR750S. It has two Choose file buttons, which can be confusing for users. You need to download the Uboot file here in advance. Repeat the above steps until you can access the Uboot Web UI. Use browser to visit http://192.168.1.1/uboot.html Click the Choose file button and choose the Uboot file you just downloaded. Click Update U-Boot button. It will take several minutes to update. After a successful update, it will reboot the router. At this time you can change the IP setting back in step 4 and try to access the web Admin Panel, if you can access the web Admin Panel normally, it means the router has been rebooted. Repeate the above steps to upgrade the firmware. If the Uboot version is updated successfully, you will see that the Uboot Web UI has changed at step 5. Click Choose file button to find the firmware file. Then click Update firmware button. Wait for around 3 minutes. Don\u2019t power off your device when updating. The router is ready when both power and Wi-Fi LED are on or you can find its SSID on your device. Revert the IP setting you did in step 4 and connect your device to the LAN or Wi-Fi of the router.

Site to Site \u00b6 Introduction \u00b6 Site to Site allows offices in multiple locations to establish secure connections with each other over internet. It extends the company's network, making computers resources from one location available to employees at other locations. Senerio 1: A company has dozens of branch offices that they wish to join in a single private network to share resources. Senerio 2: A company has a close relationship with a partner company, the Site to Site allows the companies to work together in a secure, shared network environment. Senerio 3: A family has IP camera and when they are not at home, the Site to Site allows to remote access the IP camera. Conditions \u00b6 It requires at least two routers, each in a different location, one of which has a public IP address. Please check if your ISP assigns you a public IP address . It requires firmware version 3.026 and above. Note: It is not recommended to run Site to Site while its nodes are also running VPN client, which can make the network particularly complex. Steps to build a Site to Site network \u00b6 Bind your routers to GoodCloud. ( how? ) Follow the steps below to create a Site to Site network. Default port is 51830, if you want to use another port, find the Advanced option at the lower left corner. Due to the device's performance, each Site to Site network can have up to 10 devices. After you had chosen the devices, click Continue. Then, it will test each device if it can be set as the Main Node of Site to Site. We suggest that the router with strong performance and best network speed to be the Main Node. If none of the devices can be used as the Main Node, make sure that: One of routers has a public IP, either static public IP or dynamic public IP. Port is open, default is 51830. If the router is behind NAT, you may need to set up port forwading. You can also change port and try again. If there are more than one device can be set as the Main Node, you need to choose one to continue. If there is only one device can be set as the Main Node, it will go to the Site to Site detail page directly. The network is stopped by default, check the LAN IP, if it is OK then you need to click Start button, otherwise click Setting to change LAN IP. Wait a few minutes, the node's connect status will display as lines. Solid line means connected, dashed line means disconnected. Testing the Site to Site connection \u00b6 Now the Site to Site network is created and started, let's test the connection. Use your PC or Phone to connect to one of the Node of this Site to Site, and use browser to access another Node's LAN ip, if you see the login page, the connection between these two nodes is worked. For example, my PC connect to Node 1 device, and then I use browser to access Main Node's LAN IP (192.168.48.1), if I see the login page, it means the connection between Node1 and Main Node is worked. Route and other options \u00b6 You can change each device's LAN IP and routes. By default, each node can access other's LAN, based on security, we recommend only open the corresponding service IPs. E.g. There is a Server A(172.30.97.100) in Node 1's subnet, if you want other Site to Site nodes only can access Node 1's Service A, you can set it like below: You can add node's parent routes too. Each sub Node build an encrypted tunnel netwrok to Main Node, if you want to change the IP of tunnel subnet. Click 'IP Address Range'. Batch Setting \u00b6 You can use this feature to configure multiple parameters for a single device, or you can configure multiple parameters for multiple devices. Note: This feature is only available to business users. Batch Setting of Single Device \u00b6 To configure single device, as show below. The left side of image below is correct.

There are three cases: Some models have a built-in 3G/4G model with single SIM card, like GL-XE300(Puli). Please refer to Setup for single SIM models . Some models have a usb port and can be plugged into a usb 3G/4G modem, like GL-AXT1800(Slate AX). Please refer to Setup for single SIM models . Some models have a built-in modem and support dual SIM cards, like GL-X3000(Spitz AX). Its interface may be slightly different. Please refer to Setup for Dual-SIM models . Note: Some SIM cards may need to be activated the first time you use them, so please activate them in your phone before using them in your router. Setup for single SIM models \u00b6 The following configuration steps are for built-in modem or external USB modem with only single SIM card. Here we use the GL-AXT1800 (Slate AX) with external USB modem as an example. On the left side of web Admin Panel -> INTERNET, Cellular sector. We recommend to turn off the router first, insert your SIM card into the USB modem then plug the USB modem into the USB port of the router, and then turn it on again. If you insert a usb modem at power on, the page may be no change, please refresh the page. Please access the web Admin Panel -> INTERNET, Cellular sector. The first time, it may not connect automatically, but it has read the name of your carrier in the upper left corner and the IMEI, then please click Auto Setup . Please ignore the warning of Incompatible Modem Connecting. Note: Some SIM cards may have special usage restrictions, such as the need to use a special APN. If your SIM card can't be registered, please consult your network operator if it has special restrictions. After a while, it will be connected. Otherwise, try Manual Setup . When the usb modem is plugged into the router the second time it is powered on, it is usually automatically recognized and a connection is established. It may not get the information of signal, modem name and IMEI. Manual Setup \u00b6 Sometimes, Auto Setup may not work, you can try Manual Setup . Compatible Modems \u00b6 Here is a list of supported modems that we had tested before. Model 3G/4G Tested Tested by Comments* Quectel EC20-E, EC20-A, EC20-C 4G Yes GL.iNet Quectel EC25-E, EC25-A, EC25-V, EC25-C 4G Yes GL.iNet Quectel UC20-E 3G Yes GL.iNet ZTE ME909s-821 4G Yes GL.iNet Huawei E1550 3G Yes GL.iNet Huawei E3276 4G Yes GL.iNet TP-Link MA260 3G Yes GL.iNet ZTE M823 4G Yes Arnas Risqianto ZTE MF190 3G Yes Arnas Risqianto Huawei E3372 4G Yes anonymous Pantech UML290VW (Verizon) 4G Yes GL.iNet/steven QMI Pantech UML295 (Verizon) 4G Yes GL.iNet/steven Host-less Novatel USB551L (Verizon) 4G Yes GL.iNet/steven QMI Verizon U620L (Verizon) 4G Yes Host-less QMI: This modem supports QMI mode.

You can also search on the forum or create a post for asking. Setup for Dual-SIM models \u00b6 Some models have a built-in modem and support dual SIM cards, and the interface may be slightly different compare to one SIM card model. Here take the GL-X3000 (Spitz AX) as an example. It supports \"Dual SIM, Single Standby\", which means it can hold two SIM cards for internet access, but only one SIM card can be active at a time, and the user can switch between them. We recommend to turn off the router first, insert your SIM card into the slot, and then turn it on again. On the left side of web Admin Panel -> INTERNET, Cellular sector. When no SIM card is detected. When a SIM card is inserted. SIM card slot settings \u00b6 Click current sim card. It will open the SIM card slot settings dialog box. If two SIM cards are inserted, you can enable Auto Switch. Note : The Auto Switch feature does not immediately switch to another SIM card. On one hand, it takes time to confirm that the current SIM card cannot access the internet, and only after confirming this will it switch. On the other hand, the other SIM card is not in standby mode, so it also takes some time to activate it. Auto Switch The Internet status is detected in the same way as the settings in the Multi-WAN page. Failover Interval If Internet connection is still not available after failover, the device will switch back to the preferred SIM slot and will only retry failover after this interval. This option applies when both the preferred SIM card and the backup SIM card have no signal. If the preferred SIM card also has no signal, the device will switch to the backup SIM card and so on until one of the SIM cards has a signal. Checking Preferred Slot Status Scheduled If this option is enabled, the device will try to switch back to the preferred SIM slot at the specified time. So that you can switch back to using the preferred SIM slot when its internet connection is available. When this feature is enabled, the device will attempt to switch to the preferred SIM at this set time each day, for example, this feature is intended to prevent the backup SIM from using too much data, and if the preferred SIM still has no signal, it will fail to switch to the backup SIM. Traffic Statistics \u00b6 Manual Setup \u00b6 Click Manual Setup button, it will pop up the Cellular Settings dialog. You can view or modify the cellular settings of the current SIM card. It also stores some pre-configured settings, and you can manually add configurations to the \"Saved Settings\" as well. SMS \u00b6 Please refer to the SMS tutorial . SMS Forwarding \u00b6 Please refer to the SMS Forwarding tutorial . Modem Management \u00b6 Click the button to go to modem management page. It includes information about the modem and AT commands. Modem AT commands are instructions that are used to control modems. When the 'Shortcut' option is selected as 'Manual command', you can enter the command to be executed in the 'AT Command' field. The following AT Commands have been pre-set. Request IMEI Request QCCID Request IMSI Check Signal Quality Reset modem Operator Names Request SIM card status Carrier profile \u00b6 You can save different profiles for the same or different carriers. Click Manage profile Add a new profile or save the current profile Create the carrier own profile base on your needs You can select a saved profile next time Choose any profiles you needed Band Masking \u00b6 You can check to the band signals by click view more in cells info and decide which band with stronger signal and which band with weaker signal. Then you can force your router just connect to bands you want or never connect to some bands you don't want. Check Block or Open and select the below for bands you want to apply. Warning \u00b6 When Internet access is not available, the corresponding warning is displayed. To determine whether you can access the Internet or not, please go to Multi-WAN page. Warning: The interface is connected, but the Internet can't be accessed with IPv4 protocol. Solution: Please check if the sim card has internet access in a smart phone.

You can configure the router with multiple Internet access methods, so that when one type of Internet access is not available, it can automatically switch to another type of Internet access in a short time. Or use multiple Internet access methods at the same time, assigning the network connection to different connection methods in a certain ratio. Some models support Dual-Ethernet WAN , which will add an additional Ethernet interface on the user interface. Interface Status Tracking Method \u00b6 GL.iNet routers have up to 4 interfaces, but this varies depending on the model. They are Ethernet , Repeater , Tethering and Cellular . Here is the GL-AXT1800 as an example. The router will use the ping or httping command to track the status of the connection to the destination IP to determine if the interface is available. If the interface is available, it will show as a green dot at the begining, otherwise it is gray. The setting of Interface Status Tracking Method You can disable the interface status tracking, the router will use the physical status of the interface (such as whether the network cable is plugged in or not). Multi-WAN methods \u00b6 There are two methods, Failover and Load Balance . Failover and Load Balance are mutually exclusive functions, and you can only use one of them. Failover \u00b6 You can set the priority of each interface, when the interface being used fails, the router will automatically switch to another available highest priority interface. For example, if the router has been set up with two types of Internet access, Ethernet and Repeater , and the priority of of Ethernet is 1, the priority of Repeater is 2, the priority of Ethernet is higher than Repeater, so the router will use the Ethernet to access Internet. If you unpluged the ethernet cable, the Ethernet interface will become unavailable, then the router will automatically switch to Repeater interface to access Internet. After a while, if the Ethernet interface becomes available again, the router will continue to use Repeater if the Forced Refresh Streams is off, and vice versa, the router will switch back to the higher priority Ethernet. Load Balance \u00b6 Use multiple interfaces at the same time to increase the total bandwidth of the router. The system will assign interfaces to new connections based on the load ratio. The load ratio here can simply be set according to the bandwidth ratio. For example, if the bandwidth of Ethernet is 200Mbps, the bandwidth of Repeater's WiFi is 100Mbps, and no Tethering is connected, then the load ratio of Ethernet can be set to 2, the load ratio of Repeater to 1, and the load ratio of Tethering to 0. Note: Alive connections or traffic are not ensured to match the load ratio. It is closer to this ratio if it has been used for a longer time. Usage Scenarios \u00b6 The store's cashier system uses a wired connection to the Internet, while Repeater to Wi-Fi in neighboring stores (or inserting a SIM card to enable cellular network) as a backup Internet access method to prevent mobile payments from being made when the network cable is unavailable. Router Repeater to public WiFi, but the network speed is not fast enough, then you can use Mobile Tethering to do load balance at the same time to improve the overall bandwidth. Still have questions?

Start OpenVPN server Click the Start button in the upper right corner on OpenVPN Server page to start the server. Then go to VPN Dashboard page to check its status and other settings. To check if OpenVPN Server is working properly \u00b6 Many people mis-understandstool once they saw the server is up and think it is connected. The server can be up even you forward a wrong port or wrong address. To check if OpenVPN Server is working properly, we can use another device connected to another network and use the OpenVPN configuration we exported earlier, to connect and see whether it connects properly and whether the IP address is the IP of OpenVPN Server. The simpliest way is to use a cell phone with OpenVPN official client app installed, turn off its Wi-Fi connection, and only connect to Internet via 3G/4G/5G. Then open the OpenVPN app, import the OpenVPN configuration we previously exported. Enable the connection, check if the phone has Internet access and whether its IP address is the IP of your OpenVPN Server. When importing the configuration file to the OpenVPN app, it may has a reminder as below, please click CONTINUE as the certificate is already included in the configuration file.

For more information about Tailscale, please access their website . The Tailscale feature in GL.iNet router allow the router to join the Tailscale virtual network, then you can access it remotely, even to its WAN or LAN resources. Note : Because Tailscale is based on WireGuard, it is not recommended to use the Tailscale feature with the OpenVPN Client or WireGuard Client at the same time, as there may be bugs. Note : This feature is currently in beta, and may have some bugs.

Binding \u00b6 Please register a Tailscale account first. For testing purposes, first bind one or two devices to your Tailscale account. After binding, you will be able to see your devices and their status in the Tailscale Admin console. On the left side -> APPLICATIONS -> Tailscale Toggle to enable Tailscale, then click Apply . It will show a Device Bind Link . Click the Device Bind Link. It will pop up and show a tailscale link, click it. The link will open in your browser and ask you to log in to your Tailscale account. Once logged in, you will be asked to confirm the device you want to connect to. Click Connect . When the connection is successful, you will automatically be redirected to the admin console. You can see here that the IP of the GL-MT2500 is 100.88.54.21 , and you can use this IP to access the router. Test connectivity \u00b6 Now that the GL-MT2500 is connected to the Tailscale virtual network, you can test it on other devices as fellows three ways. Use ping command SSH to the router Access web Admin Panel Allow Remote Access WAN \u00b6 If this option is enabled, the resources on the WAN side of the device will be allowed to be accessed via the Tailscale virtual network. For example, as shown below, if this function is enabled, you can access GL-AXT1800 by its IP( 192.168.29.1 ) from leo-phone , because GL-AX1800 is connected to the WAN port of GL-MT2500 , which is the upper layer device of GL-MT2500 . The operation steps are as follows. Enable Allow Remote Access WAN. Go to admin console of Tailscale, it will display an alert that GL-MT2500 has subnets. Click on the GL-MT2500 menu and select Edit route settings . Enable the subnet routes. Now you can access GL-AXT1800 by its IP( 192.168.29.1 ) on other machines. You can actually access the devices at 192.168.29.0/24 . Allow Remote Access LAN \u00b6 If this option is enabled, the resources inside the device LAN will be allowed to be accessed via the Tailscale virtual network. For example, as show below, if this function is enabled, you can SSH to Ubuntu by its IP( 192.168.8.110 ) from leo-phone , because Ubuntu is connected to the LAN port of GL-MT2500 , which is the lower layer device of GL-MT2500 . The operation steps are as follows. Enable Allow Remote Access LAN. Go to admin console of Tailscale, it will display an alert that GL-MT2500 has subnets. Click on the GL-MT2500 menu and select Edit route settings . Enable the subnet routes. Now you can ping or SSH the by its IP( 192.168.8.110 ) on other devices. You can actually access the devices at 192.168.8.0/24 . Custom Exit Nodes \u00b6 The exit node feature lets you route all non-Tailscale internet traffic through a specific device on your network. The device routing your traffic is called an \u201cexit node\u201d. Note : GL.iNet router is not yet available as an exit node, this feature is still under development. Setup Steps: On the device you wish to use as an exit node, select Run exit node . On Windows, follow the steps below. Click Yes . Set up the device as an exit node in the Admin console. Enable Custom Exit Nodes in your router, click the refresh button, and select the IP of the device that has been set up as an exit node from the drop-down menu, then click Apply . That is it.

It creates a private, virtual network that allows devices to communicate as if they were on the same local network, regardless of their physical location or network topology. ZeroTier is designed to be easy to set up and use, and offers features such as end-to-end encryption, network segmentation, and network bridging capabilities. The ZeroTier feature in GL.iNet router allow the router to join the ZeroTier virtual network, then you can access it remotely, even to its WAN or LAN resources. Note : Because ZeroTier is based on WireGuard, it is not recommended to use the ZeroTier feature with the OpenVPN Client or WireGuard Client at the same time, as there may be bugs. Note : This feature is currently in beta, and may have some bugs.

Create your first ZeroTier network Refer to ZeroTier's official Getting Started documentation to create a ZeroTier account and network. Remember to take note of the Network ID, which is a 16-digit combination of letters and numbers, as it will be needed when connecting other devices later on. Enable ZeroTier on GL.iNet router Access router's web Admin Panel, on the left side -> APPLICATIONS -> ZeroTier Enable the toggle button, fill in the Network ID in the first step then click Apply . After a while the interface will indicate that authorization is required, which we will handle in the next step. To facilitate testing, add another device (such as a computer or phone) to the ZeroTier network following the instructions in this document . Authorize your device on your network To authorize your device on your network, click on the ZeroTier Central icon and navigate to the Members section of the settings for your network on the ZeroTier website. Locate the new device and click on the Auth checkbox to authorize it. Customize the name of the device if desired. Note : The device's Address should be displayed on the ZeroTier page of the router, but this feature may be added in future versions. To confirm the current Address of the ZeroTier on your router, SSH into the router and use the \"zerotier-cli info\" command. After a short while, ZeroTier will assign a Managed IP to the device. Take note of this IP address as it will be used in the testing step. Test connectivity \u00b6 On another device that is also on the same ZeroTier network, use a web browser to access the router's web Admin Panel using the Managed IP obtained in the previous step. Normally, you will be able to access the web Admin Panel of the router. You can also use the ping command mentioned in the official documentation to test it. Allow Remote Access WAN \u00b6 If this option is enabled, the resources on the WAN side of the device will be allowed to be accessed via the ZeroTier virtual network. For example, as shown below, if this function is enabled, you can access GL-AXT1800 by its IP( 192.168.29.1 ) from leo-phone , because GL-AX1800 is connected to the WAN port of GL-MT2500 , which is the upper layer device of GL-MT2500 . The operation steps are as follows. Enable Allow Remote Access WAN. It will prompt you to set up routing rules. Go to the my.zerotier.com or click on ZeroTier Central in the image above, find the Advanced sector of settings panel. Fill in the route (Destination and Via) requested in the previous step. Click Submit . After adding. Now you can access GL-AXT1800 by its IP( 192.168.29.1 ) on other machines. You can actually access the devices at 192.168.29.0/24 . Allow Remote Access LAN \u00b6 If this option is enabled, the resources inside the device LAN will be allowed to be accessed via the ZeroTier virtual network. For example, as show below, if this function is enabled, you can SSH to Ubuntu by its IP( 192.168.8.110 ) from leo-phone , because Ubuntu is connected to the LAN port of GL-MT2500 , which is the lower layer device of GL-MT2500 . The operation steps are as follows. Enable Allow Remote Access LAN. It will prompt you to set up routing rules. Go to the my.zerotier.com or click on ZeroTier Central in the image above, find the Advanced sector of settings panel. Fill in the route (Destination and Via) requested in the previous step.
