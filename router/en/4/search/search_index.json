This device is certified based on IOT type devices. In theory, the device can only use IOT type SIM cards. If you are not sure about the card type, you need to consult the operator</p> <p>Common SIM types are: data only, data only+voice, IOT, Hostpot. It is recommended to use IOT and Hostpot; not sure about data only, data only+voice can definitely be used.</p> <p>3.2 Some SIM cards need to be activated on the mobile phone. You can try to confirm on the mobile phone that the mobile phone card can connect to the internet, and then move it to the router for use.</p> <p>3.3 Some customized cards can only be used on mobile phones or specific devices. Please confirm whether the sim must be bound to a specific device for use.</p> <p>3.4 In some states or cities in the United States (such as AT&amp;T Seattle), you may need to upload the IMEI to the operator's server.</p> <p>3.5 If it prompts that the SIM card registration failed, it is most likely that the SIM cannot be used on the router. Please consult the operator's customer service for details.</p> <p>3.6 If the SIM card can be registered and the IP address can be obtained, but cannot be connected to the Internet (only data can be uploaded but not downloaded), in this case, it is most likely that it has been banned by the operator's backend. You need to ask the operator to lift the restriction, or try Set TTL to 65 for testing, please refer to pictures below.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If none of the above measures solve the problem, you can try sending an email to support@glinet.biz and contact our technical support staff for support.</p> <p>Still have questions?

This will allow you to use the static IP address for certain networks and not others. </p> <p>From the Apple menu, select System Preferences.</p> <p>Select Network. The window shown below appears.</p> <p></p> <p>From the sidebar, select an active network interface. In this example, I\u2019m connected to a wireless network, so I\u2019ll select Wi-Fi.</p> <p>Make a note of the current IP address assigned to your Mac. You\u2019ll need to select a new IP address from within the private IP address range listed. More on that in a minute.</p> <p>Click Advanced.</p> <p>Select TCP/IP. The window shown below appears.</p> <p></p> <p>From the Configure IPv4 menu, select Manually.</p> <p>Enter a static IP address in the IPv4 Address field. What number should you enter? One method is to take your current IP address and change the last part of the number. In this example, I could have picked any address between 192.168.7.0 and 192.168.7.255, as long as the address was not already assigned to another device.</p> <p>Click OK -&gt; Click Apply.</p> <p>The steps will vary with different versions of Android.
