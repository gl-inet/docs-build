In some extreme cases, we recommend upgrading the Uboot version. Please refer to the tutorial below.</p> Upgrade the Uboot version <p>Upgrading uboot is very danerous and may brick your router. Only do this when it is necessary or being instructed.</p> <p>Mark sure you are using the correct uboot file </p> <p>Following figure shows the Web UI of the old Uboot version of GL-AR750S. It has two Choose file buttons, which can be confusing for users.</p> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>You need to download the Uboot file here in advance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repeat the above steps until you can access the Uboot Web UI.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use browser to visit http://192.168.1.1/uboot.html</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Click the Choose file button and choose the Uboot file you just downloaded.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click Update U-Boot button.</p> </li> <li> <p>It will take several minutes to update. After a successful update, it will reboot the router.</p> </li> <li> <p>At this time you can change the IP setting back in step 4 and try to access the web Admin Panel, if you can access the web Admin Panel normally, it means the router has been rebooted.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repeate the above steps to upgrade the firmware. If the Uboot version is updated successfully, you will see that the Uboot Web UI has changed at step 5. </p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Click Choose file button to find the firmware file. Then click Update firmware button.</p> </li> <li> <p>Wait for around 3 minutes. Don't power off your device when updating. The router is ready when both power and  Wi-Fi LED are on or you can find its SSID on your device.</p> </li> <li> <p>Revert the IP setting you did in step 4 and connect your device to the LAN or Wi-Fi of the router. You will be able to access the router via 192.168.8.1 again.</p> <p>Note: It might be required to use the incognito mode or to delete the browser cache and cookies to access the router.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Still have questions?

Please consult the operator's customer service for details.</p> <p>3.6 If the SIM card can be registered and the IP address can be obtained, but cannot be connected to the Internet (only data can be uploaded but not downloaded), in this case, it is most likely that it has been banned by the operator's backend.

Spitz AX supports viewing your GPS location using the command line but does not currently support showing your location on the map.</p> <p>To avoid signal attenuation, the radio frequency cable from the roof antenna to your Spitz AX should not exceed 5 meters. (For example, when the radio frequency cable from MobileMark is 5 meters long, the signal reception at 3000MHz is reduced by 3dB, which is half the strength.
