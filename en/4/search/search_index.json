Senerio 3: A family has IP camera and when they are not at home, the Site to Site allows to remote access the IP camera. Conditions \u00b6 It requires at least two routers, each in a different location, one of which has a public IP address. Please check if your ISP assigns you a public IP address . It requires firmware version 3.026 and above. Note: It is not recommended to run Site to Site while its nodes are also running VPN client, which can make the network particularly complex. Steps to build a Site to Site network \u00b6 Bind your routers to GoodCloud. ( how? ) Follow the steps below to create a Site to Site network. Default port is 51830, if you want to use another port, find the Advanced option at the lower left corner. Due to the device's performance, each Site to Site network can have up to 10 devices. After you had chosen the devices, click Continue. Then, it will test each device if it can be set as the Main Node of Site to Site. We suggest that the router with strong performance and best network speed to be the Main Node. If none of the devices can be used as the Main Node, make sure that: One of routers has a public IP, either static public IP or dynamic public IP. Port is open, default is 51830. If the router is behind NAT, you may need to set up port forwading. You can also change port and try again. If there are more than one device can be set as the Main Node, you need to choose one to continue. If there is only one device can be set as the Main Node, it will go to the Site to Site detail page directly. The network is stopped by default, check the LAN IP, if it is OK then you need to click Start button, otherwise click Setting to change LAN IP. Wait a few minutes, the node's connect status will display as lines. Solid line means connected, dashed line means disconnected. Testing the Site to Site connection \u00b6 Now the Site to Site network is created and started, let's test the connection. Use your PC or Phone to connect to one of the Node of this Site to Site, and use browser to access another Node's LAN ip, if you see the login page, the connection between these two nodes is worked. For example, my PC connect to Node 1 device, and then I use browser to access Main Node's LAN IP (192.168.48.1), if I see the login page, it means the connection between Node1 and Main Node is worked. Route and other options \u00b6 You can change each device's LAN IP and routes. By default, each node can access other's LAN, based on security, we recommend only open the corresponding service IPs. E.g. There is a Server A(172.30.97.100) in Node 1's subnet, if you want other Site to Site nodes only can access Node 1's Service A, you can set it like below: You can add node's parent routes too. Each sub Node build an encrypted tunnel netwrok to Main Node, if you want to change the IP of tunnel subnet. Click 'IP Address Range'. Batch Setting \u00b6 You can use this feature to configure multiple parameters for a single device, or you can configure multiple parameters for multiple devices. Note: This feature is only available to business users. Batch Setting of Single Device \u00b6 To configure single device, as show below. The left side of image below is correct. If your interface is like the right side of image below, please upgrade to latest testing firmware. Check the configuration that needs to be modified and input value. The checked configuration is required, and only the configuration that conforms to the rule can be filled out. After the configuration is delivered, it does not take effect immediately. The configuration takes effect and the device needs to be restarted. You can check the Restart now option in the lower right corner of the above figure. After the configuration is completed, the device will restart immediately. Preview the configuration and confirm the delivery. Unchecked Restart now option will prompt. Batch Setting of Mutiple Devices \u00b6 Select the devices you want to configure. Other operations are the same as when operating a single device. Other Batch Operations \u00b6 Other Batch Operations: Move to other group, upgrade, restart, delete. Template Management \u00b6 Save frequently used configurations as templates and quickly apply them when you modify configurations in batches. Note: This feature is only available to business users. Add a Template \u00b6 Check the configuration that needs to be modified and input value. Most of the options are the same as those on web Admin Panel. Upgrade \u00b6 Upgrade Path is for upgrading custom firmware. Put the firmware and a text file on a web server, then put the url path on the Upgrade Path . For example, https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/ is a Upgrade Path, it has a list-sha256.txt file https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/list-sha256.txt and a corresponding firmware file https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/openwrt-ar750-3.203-0701.bin . Note: GL-AX1800, GL-S1300, GL-B1300, GL-AP1300 only support http path for now. The content of the text file is like this , its name should be list-sha256.txt . It has 4 columns, the first column is firmware version, the second column is the name of firmware file, the thrid column is the sha256 of firmware file, the forth column is the size of firmware file. Give the template a name and description. Apply a template to a router \u00b6 If you have created a template, then want to apply this template to a router. On the Device List page, find the router that you want to apply the template, make sure it is online, on the Actions column, click the cog icon, click Modify Configuration item. It will pop up a dialog Configure batch modification . On the top right corner of the dialog, you can choose a template that has already created. Then click Apply button on the bottom right corner. It will pop up another dialog to review the configuration of the template, scroll down to the bottom to click the Confirm button, it will load the configuration of template overwrite to this time modification. Click Apply button, please note that the router will restart to take effect after click the Apply button. Apply a template to multiple routers \u00b6 If you have created a template, then want to apply this template to multiple routers. This procedure is similar to that applied to a single router. On the Device List page, multiple select routers, then click Bulk Action , click Modify Configuration item. It will pop up a dialog Configure batch modification . On the top right corner of the dialog, you can choose a template that has already created. Then click Apply button on the bottom right corner. It will pop up another dialog to review the configuration of the template, scroll down to the bottom to click the Confirm button, it will load the configuration of template overwrite to this time modification. Click Apply button, please note that the router will restart to take effect after click the Apply button. Task List \u00b6 At task list page, it shows the execution result of the configuration template. Note: This feature is only available to business users. You can view the execution result of each device and configuration. GoodCloud and VPN \u00b6 If you enable GoodCloud function and running VPN client at the same time on router, by default, the connection between the router and the GoodCloud server will also go through the VPN, but sometimes the VPN connection is unstable, or the VPN provider mistakenly filters the GoodCloud connection, you can make the GoodCloud connection not go through the VPN by using the following settings. Go to web Admin Panel, on the left side, VPN -> VPN Dashboard -> VPN Client -> Global Options. It is not recommended to run Site to Site while its nodes are also running VPN client, which can make the network particularly complex. Turn off cloud \u00b6 To stop GoodCloud service, turn it off on router web Admin Panel. Please follow the steps below. No action needed on the GoodCloud website. After disable Cloud, the interface is like below. Still have questions?

Why do I need to use my router to connect to a public hotspot? \u00b6 Public Wi-Fi is not safe We cannot put enough emphasis on how public Wi-Fi is not safe. By connecting your GL.iNet router to the public wifi, you can simply login to your VPN account directly through your router\u2019s Admin Panel, and it\u2019ll automatically encrypt all connected devices within the local network, saving you from the trouble of setting up VPN on every single device. Use as a repeater to allow connections with multiple devices Besides that, some public Wi-Fi such as hotel complimentary Wi-Fi are limited to let\u2019s say 2 devices. When you\u2019re travelling in a group, that\u2019s just not going to work. Instead, you could connect a travel router to the hotel Wi-Fi, and use it as a hotspot to broadcast Wi-Fi to all your devices including laptops, smartphones, tablets\u2026etc. The hotel Wi-Fi will only recognize the travel router as a single device, but you could enjoy the free Wi-Fi as many devices as you want. How do I connect my router to a public hotspot via captive portal? \u00b6 Connect your smartphone or computer to the router. Power on the router. On your smartphone or computer, connect WiFi to your travel router by searching its SSID, and enter the WiFi password. The default password indicated as \u201cWIFI Key\u201d on the bottom of your router. Access your travel router's web admin panel. After successfully connecting to your router, go to the web admin panel of your router by visiting router IP address (default is 192.168.8.1 ) on the Internet browser. If you are logging in for the first time, select a language and create a new password for the router's web admin panel. Connect your router to the public hotspot's SSID using the Repeater function. Fill out the hotel's Captive Portal. Troubleshooting \u00b6 However, you may find that you are unable to enter the captive portal, so you cannot connect to the hotspot or access the Internet. In this case, please try the following solutions one at a time. Solution 1: Change DNS settings \u00b6 Go to web Admin Panel -> NETWORK -> DNS. Then, make sure the DNS Rebinding Attack Protection is disable and the Mode is Automatic . Go to web Admin Panel -> VPN -> VPN Dashboard. Make sure the connection of OpenVPN and WireGuard client is disable. Go to web Admin Panel -> APPLICATIONS -> AdGuard Home. Make sure the AdGuard Home is stopped. Use your web browser to visit a webpage, it will be redirected to the captive portal of the hotspot automatically. If you are using smartphone but your web browser doesn't redirect to the captive portal. Please turn off the Wi-Fi of your smartphone and then turn it on and reconnect to the Wi-Fi of your router again. The captive portal should be popped up directly after you entered the Wi-Fi password. Solution 2\uff1aMAC Clone \u00b6 Sometimes, Solution 1 is not enough to solve this issue. Some hotels limit the number of devices each customer can access by MAC address, and they record the MAC address of your phone (or other device) when it first time accesses the hotel WiFi. In this case, we need to clone the MAC address that the your phone uses to connect to the hotel WiFi to the router. Got your smartphone registered on the network. Make sure your phone is connected to the hotel WiFi. Find the MAC address that your phone uses to connect to the hotel's WiFi. Here is an example for iPhone (iOS 16.1.2), go to settings -> Wi-Fi -> Select the hotel WiFi. You will find the Wi-Fi Address, write down this address. For some old phones, the MAC address is not found there in WiFi, then it uses the real MAC address of the phone. This can be found in the phone's Settings -> About where you can find the phone's MAC address. Usr your phone or computer to connect to router, access web admin panel. On the left side of web Admin Panel -> NETWORK -> MAC Address. Select Manual Mode, fill in the MAC address you wrote down in step 2 into the input box and click Apply. It may need to reboot the router to take effect. Solution 3\uff1aAsk the help from the hotel staff \u00b6 Some hotel's network has a very strict verification policy. Neither solution 1 nor 2 is unable to make it work, then you can consult with the hotel staff if they can add the router's MAC address(the Factory default one) to their \"Whitelist\" directly.

Some hotels limit the number of devices each customer can access by MAC address, and they record the MAC address of your phone (or other device) when it first time accesses the hotel WiFi. In this case, we need to clone the MAC address that the your phone uses to connect to the hotel WiFi to the router. Got your smartphone registered on the network. Make sure your phone is connected to the hotel WiFi. Find the MAC address that your phone uses to connect to the hotel's WiFi. Here is an example for iPhone (iOS 16.1.2), go to settings -> Wi-Fi -> Select the hotel WiFi. You will find the Wi-Fi Address, write down this address. For some old phones, the MAC address is not found there in WiFi, then it uses the real MAC address of the phone. This can be found in the phone's Settings -> About where you can find the phone's MAC address. Usr your phone or computer to connect to router, access web admin panel.

Network Typology \u00b6 The diagram above has two colored lines, gray lines, and green lines with 3 arrows on the green lines, and a number next to each arrow. The gray lines show that the devices are connected to the main router, and the LAN port of the main router is connected to the WAN port of the GL.iNet router with Drop-in Gateway function via an Ethernet cable. The green lines indicate that when the Drop-in Gateway mode is enabled, all or part of the devices' data will be processed by the GL.iNet device before being sent out through the main router. Setup \u00b6 The GL.iNet router referred to below is the GL.iNet router on which you want to enable the Drop-in Gateway function. All clients use the Drop-in Gateway feature. The LAN port of the main router connect to the WAN port of the GL.iNet router via an ethernet cable. Enable Drop-in Gateway feature, it will generate the settings automatically.

There are two cases, some models have a built-in 3G/4G model; some models have a usb port and can be plugged into a usb 3G/4G modem. The operation steps are similar, here is GL-AXT1800 as an example. On the left side of web Admin Panel -> INTERNET, Cellular sector. Note: Some SIM cards may need to be activated the first time you use them, so please activate them in your phone before using them in your router. We recommend to turn off the router first, insert your SIM card into the USB modem then plug the USB modem into the USB port of the router, and then turn it on again. If you insert a usb modem at power on, the page may be no change, please refresh the page. Please access the web Admin Panel -> INTERNET, Cellular sector. The first time, it may not connect automatically, but it has read the name of your carrier in the upper left corner and the IMEI, then please click Auto Setup . Please ignore the warning of Incompatible Modem Connecting. Note: Some SIM cards may have special usage restrictions, such as the need to use a special APN. If your SIM card can't be registered, please consult your network operator if it has special restrictions. After a while, it will be connected. Otherwise, try Manual Setup . When the usb modem is plugged into the router the second time it is powered on, it is usually automatically recognized and a connection is established. It may not get the information of signal, modem name and IMEI.","title":"Connect to the Internet via cellular"},{"location":"tutorials/internet_cellular/#manual-setup","text":"Sometimes, Auto Setup may not work, you can try Manual Setup .","title":"Manual Setup"},{"location":"tutorials/internet_cellular/#compatible-modems","text":"Here is a list of supported modems that we had tested before.

You can configure the router with multiple Internet access methods, so that when one type of Internet access is not available, it can automatically switch to another type of Internet access in a short time. Or use multiple Internet access methods at the same time, assigning the network connection to different connection methods in a certain ratio. Interface Status Tracking Method \u00b6 GL.iNet routers have up to 4 interfaces, but this varies depending on the model. They are Ethernet , Repeater , Tethering and Cellular . Here is the GL-AXT1800 as an example. The router will use the ping or httping command to track the status of the connection to the destination IP to determine if the interface is available. If the interface is available, it will show as a green dot at the begining, otherwise it is gray. The setting of Interface Status Tracking Method You can disable the interface status tracking, the router will use the physical status of the interface (such as whether the network cable is plugged in or not). Multi-WAN methods \u00b6 There are two methods, Failover and Load Balance . Failover and Load Balance are mutually exclusive functions, and you can only use one of them. Failover \u00b6 You can set the priority of each interface, when the interface being used fails, the router will automatically switch to another available highest priority interface. For example, if the router has been set up with two types of Internet access, Ethernet and Repeater , and the priority of of Ethernet is 1, the priority of Repeater is 2, the priority of Ethernet is higher than Repeater, so the router will use the Ethernet to access Internet. If you unpluged the ethernet cable, the Ethernet interface will become unavailable, then the router will automatically switch to Repeater interface to access Internet. After a while, if the Ethernet interface becomes available again, the router will continue to use Repeater if the Forced Refresh Streams is off, and vice versa, the router will switch back to the higher priority Ethernet. Load Balance \u00b6 Use multiple interfaces at the same time to increase the total bandwidth of the router. The system will assign interfaces to new connections based on the load ratio. The load ratio here can simply be set according to the bandwidth ratio. For example, if the bandwidth of Ethernet is 200Mbps, the bandwidth of Repeater's WiFi is 100Mbps, and no Tethering is connected, then the load ratio of Ethernet can be set to 2, the load ratio of Repeater to 1, and the load ratio of Tethering to 0. Note: Alive connections or traffic are not ensured to match the load ratio. It is closer to this ratio if it has been used for a longer time. Usage Scenarios \u00b6 The store's cashier system uses a wired connection to the Internet, while Repeater to Wi-Fi in neighboring stores (or inserting a SIM card to enable cellular network) as a backup Internet access method to prevent mobile payments from being made when the network cable is unavailable.

TCP is more suitable for emailing, web browsing and file transfer. We recommend trying the UDP protocol first and only switching to TCP if you experience any issues. Still have questions?

For more information about Tailscale, please access their website . The Tailscale feature in GL.iNet router allow the router to join the Tailscale virtual network, then you can access it remotely, even to its WAN or LAN resources. Note : Because Tailscale is based on WireGuard, it is not recommended to use the Tailscale feature with the OpenVPN Client or WireGuard Client at the same time, as there may be bugs. Note : This feature is currently in beta, and may have some bugs.

Binding \u00b6 Please register a Tailscale account first. For testing purposes, first bind one or two devices to your Tailscale account. After binding, you will be able to see your devices and their status in the Tailscale Admin console. On the left side -> APPLICATIONS -> Tailscale Toggle to enable Tailscale, then click Apply . It will show a Device Bind Link . Click the Device Bind Link. It will pop up and show a tailscale link, click it. The link will open in your browser and ask you to log in to your Tailscale account. Once logged in, you will be asked to confirm the device you want to connect to. Click Connect . When the connection is successful, you will automatically be redirected to the admin console. You can see here that the IP of the GL-MT2500 is 100.88.54.21 , and you can use this IP to access the router. Testing \u00b6 Now that the GL-MT2500 is connected to the Tailscale virtual network, you can test it on other devices as fellows three ways. Use ping command SSH to the router Access web Admin Panel Allow Remote Access WAN \u00b6 If this option is enabled, the resources on the WAN side of the device will be allowed to be accessed via the Tailscale virtual network. For example, as shown below, if this function is enabled, you can access GL-AXT1800 by its IP( 192.168.29.1 ) from leo-phone , because GL-AX1800 is connected to the WAN port of GL-MT2500 , which is the upper layer device of GL-MT2500 . The operation steps are as follows. Enable Allow Remote Access WAN. Go to admin console of Tailscale, it will display an alert that GL-MT2500 has subnets. Click on the GL-MT2500 menu and select Edit route settings . Enable the subnet routes. Now you can access GL-AXT1800 by its IP( 192.168.29.1 ) on other machines. You can actually access the devices at 192.168.29.0/24 . Allow Remote Access LAN \u00b6 If this option is enabled, the resources inside the device LAN will be allowed to be accessed via the Tailscale virtual network. For example, as show below, if this function is enabled, you can SSH to Ubuntu by its IP( 192.168.8.110 ) from leo-phone , because Ubuntu is connected to the LAN port of GL-MT2500 , which is the lower layer device of GL-MT2500 .

As shown above, if this feature is turned on, your device will have access to devices in the upstream subnet, such as printer and NAS. The main scenario is to give clients access to devices in the upstream subnet, but there is no way for the router to distinguish between the upstream subnet and the Internet, so if the traffic in the client device is accessed directly through IP, there may be a risk of leakage, so this option and Block Non-VPN Traffic are mutually exclusive.

Network Name/ PAN ID/ Extended PAN ID/ Network Key is generated based on the MAC address of the device. Create a new network \u00b6 You can create a new network directly by using the default configuration and clicking Enable . You can then see that the status of the S200 has changed from Detached to Leader , which means that a new network has been created. Note : If you have the same network settings as an existing Thread network in your current environment, then the S200 will automatically join that network. If you want to set some parameters manually, you can configure them by clicking on the Manual Setup . Join an existing network \u00b6 We support the following 4 ways to add the S200 to an existing network. Join the network by using Network Key \u00b6 Click on the Join Network and the GL-S200 will scan the surrounding available Thread networks. Select the Thread network you want to join in the pop-up window, enter its Network Key and apply it. Join the network by using the Commissioner \u00b6 Using another GL.iNET S200 as the Commissioner (please refer to the Thread Commissioning page guide), enter the Joiner EUI64 and Joiner Credential of the S200 to be connected to the network. Click on the \" Join Network \" on the S200 to be connected to the network, select \" Join With Commissioner \" in the pop-up window, enter the Joiner Credential and apply it. A successful Join Network will automatically jump to display the status page. Networking using import Thread network configuration \u00b6 To facilitate deployment, we can import the same Thread network configuration directly to the device so that devices with the same Thread network configuration are automatically networked after they are up. You can import and export by clicking on Import Setting/Export Setting in the top right hand corner of the Thread Network page. Note : You can only export when the Thread Network is up, or import when the Thread Network is down. Join the network by using External Commissioner \u00b6 In the Thread network, the GL.iNET S200 acts as a border agent to support external commissioners, which can be a mobile phone or a PC. Download Commissioner App OT Commissioner Android App Thread Group Android App Open the app after connecting the GL-S200 via WiFi. Select one of the AVALABLE BORDER ROUTERS and click on it and enter the Commissioner Credential. If step 3 is entered correctly, you can scan the QR code on the GL-S200 Join With Commissioner page and click Apply on the GL-S200 page to start the process. Thread Commissioning \u00b6 You can add new devices to the network on this page, and GL-S200 supports bulk imports.

Joiner Credential : The device credentials to be added must be a string containing all uppercase letters and numbers and must not contain the letters I, O, Q and Z, between 6 and 32 characters in length. Joiner Timeout : Joiner access timeout, during which a Joiner can access the network using valid credentials. Add devices in batches \u00b6 If the device vendor has set different Joiner credentials for each Thread device, you will need this feature when deploying. Clicking Download template to download the template or export the saved Joiner list, fill in or add the Joiner EUI64 and Joiner Credential, then click Select to import. Thread Topologies \u00b6 The network topology data is obtained by sending multicast packets. The network topology data allows you to view information about each node such as IPv6 address, mode of operation, directly connected sub-nodes, etc. You can click on any device to view information about that device. Advanced \u00b6 We have provided some advanced configurations related to Thread networking. Normally we do not recommend that users modify these parameters. SRP Server \u00b6 SRP (Service Registration Protocol) is a service registration and discovery protocol. The IP of devices on an IP-based network is not usually fixed, so communication is not possible without determining the IP of the other end, and this SRP protocol allows automatic discovery of devices and services on the Thread network. Host: SRP Server domain. Lease: The lifetime of the DNS-SD PTR, SRV, A, AAAA and TXT records. Key Lease: The lifetime of the KEY records.
