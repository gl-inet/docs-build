Site to Site \u00b6 Introduction \u00b6 Site to Site allows offices in multiple locations to establish secure connections with each other over internet. It extends the company's network, making computers resources from one location available to employees at other locations. Senerio 1: A company has dozens of branch offices that they wish to join in a single private network to share resources. Senerio 2: A company has a close relationship with a partner company, the Site to Site allows the companies to work together in a secure, shared network environment. Senerio 3: A family has IP camera and when they are not at home, the Site to Site allows to remote access the IP camera. Conditions \u00b6 It requires at least two routers, each in a different location, one of which has a public IP address. Please check if your ISP assigns you a public IP address . It requires firmware version 3.026 and above. Note: It is not recommended to run Site to Site while its nodes are also running VPN client, which can make the network particularly complex. Steps to build a Site to Site network \u00b6 Bind your routers to GoodCloud. ( how? ) Follow the steps below to create a Site to Site network. Default port is 51830, if you want to use another port, find the Advanced option at the lower left corner. Due to the device's performance, each Site to Site network can have up to 10 devices. After you had chosen the devices, click Continue. Then, it will test each device if it can be set as the Main Node of Site to Site. We suggest that the router with strong performance and best network speed to be the Main Node. If none of the devices can be used as the Main Node, make sure that: One of routers has a public IP, either static public IP or dynamic public IP. Port is open, default is 51830. If the router is behind NAT, you may need to set up port forwading. You can also change port and try again. If there are more than one device can be set as the Main Node, you need to choose one to continue. If there is only one device can be set as the Main Node, it will go to the Site to Site detail page directly. The network is stopped by default, check the LAN IP, if it is OK then you need to click Start button, otherwise click Setting to change LAN IP. Wait a few minutes, the node's connect status will display as lines. Solid line means connected, dashed line means disconnected. Testing the Site to Site connection \u00b6 Now the Site to Site network is created and started, let's test the connection. Use your PC or Phone to connect to one of the Node of this Site to Site, and use browser to access another Node's LAN ip, if you see the login page, the connection between these two nodes is worked. For example, my PC connect to Node 1 device, and then I use browser to access Main Node's LAN IP (192.168.48.1), if I see the login page, it means the connection between Node1 and Main Node is worked. Route and other options \u00b6 You can change each device's LAN IP and routes. By default, each node can access other's LAN, based on security, we recommend only open the corresponding service IPs. E.g. There is a Server A(172.30.97.100) in Node 1's subnet, if you want other Site to Site nodes only can access Node 1's Service A, you can set it like below: You can add node's parent routes too. Each sub Node build an encrypted tunnel netwrok to Main Node, if you want to change the IP of tunnel subnet. Click 'IP Address Range'. Batch Setting \u00b6 You can use this feature to configure multiple parameters for a single device, or you can configure multiple parameters for multiple devices. Note: This feature is only available to business users. Batch Setting of Single Device \u00b6 To configure single device, as show below. The left side of image below is correct. If your interface is like the right side of image below, please upgrade to latest testing firmware. Check the configuration that needs to be modified and input value. The checked configuration is required, and only the configuration that conforms to the rule can be filled out. After the configuration is delivered, it does not take effect immediately. The configuration takes effect and the device needs to be restarted. You can check the Restart now option in the lower right corner of the above figure. After the configuration is completed, the device will restart immediately. Preview the configuration and confirm the delivery. Unchecked Restart now option will prompt. Batch Setting of Mutiple Devices \u00b6 Select the devices you want to configure. Other operations are the same as when operating a single device. Other Batch Operations \u00b6 Other Batch Operations: Move to other group, upgrade, restart, delete. Template Management \u00b6 Save frequently used configurations as templates and quickly apply them when you modify configurations in batches. Note: This feature is only available to business users. Add a Template \u00b6 Check the configuration that needs to be modified and input value. Most of the options are the same as those on web Admin Panel. Upgrade \u00b6 Upgrade Path is for upgrading custom firmware. Put the firmware and a text file on a web server, then put the url path on the Upgrade Path . For example, https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/ is a Upgrade Path, it has a list-sha256.txt file https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/list-sha256.txt and a corresponding firmware file https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/openwrt-ar750-3.203-0701.bin . Note: GL-AX1800, GL-S1300, GL-B1300, GL-AP1300 only support http path for now. The content of the text file is like this , its name should be list-sha256.txt . It has 4 columns, the first column is firmware version, the second column is the name of firmware file, the thrid column is the sha256 of firmware file, the forth column is the size of firmware file. Give the template a name and description. Apply a template to a router \u00b6 If you have created a template, then want to apply this template to a router. On the Device List page, find the router that you want to apply the template, make sure it is online, on the Actions column, click the cog icon, click Modify Configuration item. It will pop up a dialog Configure batch modification . On the top right corner of the dialog, you can choose a template that has already created. Then click Apply button on the bottom right corner. It will pop up another dialog to review the configuration of the template, scroll down to the bottom to click the Confirm button, it will load the configuration of template overwrite to this time modification. Click Apply button, please note that the router will restart to take effect after click the Apply button. Apply a template to multiple routers \u00b6 If you have created a template, then want to apply this template to multiple routers. This procedure is similar to that applied to a single router. On the Device List page, multiple select routers, then click Bulk Action , click Modify Configuration item. It will pop up a dialog Configure batch modification . On the top right corner of the dialog, you can choose a template that has already created. Then click Apply button on the bottom right corner. It will pop up another dialog to review the configuration of the template, scroll down to the bottom to click the Confirm button, it will load the configuration of template overwrite to this time modification. Click Apply button, please note that the router will restart to take effect after click the Apply button. Task List \u00b6 At task list page, it shows the execution result of the configuration template. Note: This feature is only available to business users. You can view the execution result of each device and configuration. GoodCloud and VPN \u00b6 If you enable GoodCloud function and running VPN client at the same time on router, by default, the connection between the router and the GoodCloud server will also go through the VPN, but sometimes the VPN connection is unstable, or the VPN provider mistakenly filters the GoodCloud connection, you can make the GoodCloud connection not go through the VPN by using the following settings. Go to web Admin Panel, on the left side, VPN -> VPN Dashboard -> VPN Client -> Global Options. It is not recommended to run Site to Site while its nodes are also running VPN client, which can make the network particularly complex. Turn off cloud \u00b6 To stop GoodCloud service, turn it off on router web Admin Panel. Please follow the steps below. No action needed on the GoodCloud website. After disable Cloud, the interface is like below.","title":"GoodCloud"},{"location":"tutorials/cloud/#glinet-goodcloud","text":"","title":"GL.iNet GoodCloud"},{"location":"tutorials/cloud/#contents","text":"Introduction Setup Enable GoodCloud on router Sign up GoodCloud account Select server region Add a new group Add device Bound info on router web Admin Panel Unbind router Manage your devices Devices info and status LTE Signal Device detail info Remote access web Admin Panel Remote access router's terminal Set email alarm Site to Site Introduction Conditions Steps to build a Site to Site network Testing the Site to Site connection Route and other options Batch Setting Batch Setting of Single Device Batch Setting of Mutiple Devices Other Batch Operations Template Management Add a Template Upgrade Apply a template to a router Apply a template to multiple routers Task List GoodCloud and VPN Turn off cloud","title":"Contents"},{"location":"tutorials/cloud/#introduction","text":"GL.iNet GoodCloud cloud management service provide an easy and simple way to remotely access and manage routers.
