You can compile a firmware with tons of features and writing data is almost instant.\n\n\nBy adding PCIe interface, a 5G 802.11a/ac addon module can be connected and you can enjoy the wifi speed on a mini router.\n\n\nPerformance\n\n\nBy adding a fast Nand flash, you can feel how the performance is improved compared to a Nor flash router.\n\n\nThe performance comparision between AR300M (nand) with AR150 is below:\n\n\n\n\nIt only takes 6 seconds to upload and process 250 ovpn files. When installing packages to the router, it takes no more than 20% for the time spent than using nor flash, including the time to download resource from the Internet. So everything just happends in seconds.\n\n\nBuilding Firmware\n\n\nThe router has two flash so we have two firmwares. One firmware is installed on the Nor flash and one is installed on the nand flash. The two firmware is independent from each other. The router will always try to boot from the nand flash. If it fails for 3 times it will boot from the Nor flash.\n\n\nBy using two firmwares, businesses can have dual boot options to ensure the system can backup, upgrade and boot without problems.\n\n\nBuilding the generic firmware for nor flash\n\n\nThe simple instructions of building the firmware can be found here: https://github.com/gl-inet/lede-17.01\nYou need to have a Linux machine. In this example we use Ubuntu.\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install subversion build-essential git-core libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk flex quilt libssl-dev xsltproc libxml-parser-perl mercurial bzr ecj cvs unzip git wget\n$ git clone https://github.com/domino-team/openwrt-cc.git\n$ cd openwrt-cc\n$ ./scripts/feeds update -a\n$ ./scripts/feeds install -a\n$ make menuconfig\n  ..choose your compile target and packages\n$ make\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to build the firmware for nor flash, choose \nGL-AR300M\n as the target.\n\n\n\n\nBuild the nand firmware for nand flash\n\n\nIf you want to build the firmware for nand flash, first choose subtarget \nGeneric devices with NAND flash\n then choose \nGL-AR300M Nand\n as the target.\n\n\n\n\nThe make process will takes around 1 hour for the first time because it needs to download a lot of data from t he Internet. After compiling finished, you will find the following firmware files in \nbin/ar71xx/\n\n\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-generic-gl-ar300m-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin\n, for nor flash\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-nand-gl-ar300m-squashfs-sysupgrade.tar\n, for nand flash firmware upgrade inside of a working Openwrt firmware\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-nand-gl-ar300m-ubi.img\n, for initial nand flash firmware build, this is used when upgrading using uboot.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThere is two file for nand firmware. The \nxxx-ubi.img\n is used for first time writing to the nand flash. If you are using uboot to upgrade the firmware, please use this one. The \nxxx-sysupgrade.tar\n is used for upgrading from openwrt. So if you use our stock firmware or already using an openwrt firmware, choose this one.\n\n\nUsing Firmware\n\n\nThe firmware has exactly the same UI as our other mini routers. To determine you are using nor flash or nand flash, please check the available space from the UI.\n\n\nControl which firmware you are booting into\n\n\nThere are two methods to control which firmware you can boot.\n\n\nMethod 1: set boot count\n\n\nThe router will always try to boot into the nand firmware. But if it fails for 3 times it will try to boot into the nor firmware. If you want to boot into the nor firmware, you can tell the router that it failed to boot for 3 times already by setting the uboot env. To do so, you can use the following command in a SSH terminal.\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv bootcount 3\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nYou need to do this each time\n if you want to boot into nor firmware, no matter you which firmware you are using. Otherwise after the firmware boot, it will reset \nbootcount\n variable and next boot will always try to boot the nand firmware.\n\n\nMethod 2: using the switch\n\n\nThis is only valid in the new uboot (from Mar 2017).\n\n\nFirst ssh to the router and set uboot env \nboot_dev\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv boot_dev on\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nThen when the router boot, the router will choose which firmware to boot using the hardware switch.\n1. Left side (near the reset button) --\n Nand flash\n2. Right side  --\n Nor flash\n\n\nTo disable using the switch to choose firmware function, clear \nboot_dev\n variable.\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv boot_dev\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nDebrick\n\n\nIf you brick your router and it cannot boot, you can try to save it using uboot.\n\n\nUsing uboot web UI\n\n\nFollow \nthis guide\n for a general instruction to get access of uboot web UI.\n\n\nHere is a video guide for entering AR300M uboot failsafe. \n\n\n\nIn some early version of AR300M, the uboot boot very slowly. So be patient when you press and hold the reset button. The LEDs will start to flash around 5 seconds.\n\n\nThere is a bug in AR300M uboot and in some computers the connection will always reset when you upload firmware.

Modify its content and change the TFTP_DIRECTORY to your folder which will contains your files.\n\n\nTFTP_USERNAME=\nTFTP\n\nTFTP_DIRECTORY=\n/tftpboot\n\nTFTP_ADDRESS=\n[::]:69\n\nTFTP_OPTIONS=\n--secure\n\n\n\n\n\nSometime the service cannot be started because network is not available when it starts.

I am using openwrt toolchain. Make modification to the \nMakefile\n.\n\n\nexport BUILD_TOPDIR=$(PWD)\nexport STAGING_DIR=$(BUILD_TOPDIR)/tmp\n\n# **Replace the following line with your real path**\nexport TOOLPATH=$(BUILD_TOPDIR)/../openwrt/staging_dir/toolchain-mips_34kc_gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2/\n\nexport PATH:=$(TOOLPATH)/bin:${PATH}\n\nexport MAKECMD=make --silent --no-print-directory ARCH=mips CROSS_COMPILE=mips-openwrt-linux-uclibc-\n\n# boot delay (time to autostart boot command)\nexport CONFIG_BOOTDELAY=1\n\n\n\n\nNow start to compile the source. For example, for GL.iNet 6416, you can use:\n\n\nmake gl-inet\n\n\n\n\n\nFor GL-AR150, you can do this:\n\n\nmake 8devices_carambola2\n\n\n\n\nFor GL-AR300 and GL-AR300M, we modified the code a lot so please consult us for details.\n\n\nIt should be very quick and finish in minutes. Then you will find \nuboot_for_gl-inet.bin\n in \nbin/\n.\n\n\nGL-AR150 uboot modify as IoT devices\n\n\nIf you connect IoT addon to AR150's UART, which talks to AR150 using serial. When the IoT addon send some data during uboot boot, it may stop the booting process so you never have the router alive. You need to modify the uboot a little bit so that it can succesffuly boot. \n\n\nUse this code from github \nhttps://github.com/domino-team/uboot-domino\n\n\nIn this uboot, you need to type \ngl\n quickly during uboot boot to enter uboot console.\n\n\nMT300A, MT300N, MT750\n\n\nMT series routers use a different uboot and different code. Consult us if you need.\n\n\nUsing uboot\n\n\nYou can use \nprintenv\n to display the environment variables in uboot. here are some quick guide of how to use uboot.\n\n\nFirst you need to set up tftp server as above and put your files in tftp root folder.\n\n\nbasic uboot command\n\n\nDownload file to router\n (AR150, Domino, 6416 as example)\n\n\ntftp 0x81000000 file.bin\n\n\n\n\nErase some part of flash\n\n\nerase 0x9f050000 +0x10000\n\n\n\n\nWrite file to flash\n\n\ncp.b 0x81000000 0x9f050000 0x10000\n\n\n\n\npredefined script\n\n\nActually it is not easy to use basic uboot command to do everyting. It is quite risky. Fortunately we have some pre-defined scripts that simplifeis the work.\n\n\nPlase do check using \nprintenv\n to find out the correct filename that the script trying to download. \nFor example, if you want to update uboot for AR150, the uboot file should be named as \nuboot_for_gl-ar150.bin\n and put in your tftp root folder.\n\n\nReplace uboot\n\n\nrun lu\n\n\n\n\nUpdate firmware\n\n\nrun lf\n\n\n\n\nUpdate mac address etc\n\n\nrun lc\n\n\n\n\nErase uboot env variables\n\nBe sure to use the right command for the right model\nFor AR150, Domino AR300, AR300M\n\n\nerase 0x9f040000 +0x10000\nreset\n\n\n\n\nFor 6416\n\n\nerase 0x9f010000 +0x10000\nreset\n\n\n\n\nUboot Web UI\n\n\nUboot has a webUI so that you can save your device without entering uboot console.\n\n\n\n\nCheck \nthis section\n  for how to enter uboot web UI using the reset button.\n\n\nIf you are in uboot console, you can start the WebUI the following command. This only works for AR series, not MT series.\n\n\nhttpd\n\n\n\n\nAR300M Specific\n\n\nAR300M uses dual flash so in uboot there are a lot of things to deal with dual flash.

You can use the data for your laptop.\n\n\nUsing your phone as a hotspot directly is easy, but you cannot connect too many devices.\n\n\n\n\nIt is very easy to share your data to GL.iNet mini router using router's control interfaces, but in some phone and carrier network, they limit sharing data directly, so you can try EasyTether.\n\n\nWe will use Android OS and GL mini router to demonstrate the procedure.\n\n\nStuff you need\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\n1)     Samsung Galaxy S6 with Android OS\n\n\n2)     GL-AR150 mini router (Other models are also OK)\n\n\n3)     4G sim card\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\n1)     WinSCP (\nhttps://winscp.net/eng/download.php\n)\n\n\n\n\n2)     PuTTY (\nhttps://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html\n)\n\n\n\n\n3)     EasyTether driver openssl (\nhttp://www.mobile-stream.com/easytether/drivers.html\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u200b         \nNote: For MT300N-V2, please choose LEDE.\n\n\n\n\n4)     EasyTether Android App (Search in Google Play Store)\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\nPreparing your router\n\n\n1) Set up the router\n\n\nEnter 192.168.8.1 in your browser and get into the router web interface. Set the password which will be used for OpenWRT later. Next, update your router to the latest firmware.\n\n\n2) Transfer IPK driver package to the router\n\n\ni.\n Find out the chip of your model (for example Atheros 9531, MediaTek MT7620N, etc) from the website. It is because you have to choose the IPK driver package in the EasyTether driver file base on the chip of your router. (For GL router, you can find the information on our website: www.gl-inet.com, and we will also indicate the position of the IPK driver file for our mini router in section iv.):\n\n\n\n\nii.\n Extract the EasyTether driver file. Open WinSCP, choose SCP as the file protocol and enter the information as the figure shown below:\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the following screen once your connection has been established (left-hand side: Your PC, right-hand side: Your router):\n\n\n\n\niii.\n Go to the main folder by clicking this button.\n\n\n\n\nYou will see the directory tree of the router:\n\n\n\n\niv.\n On the left-hand side (Your PC), find the IPK file of your router in EasyTether driver file you have extracted before. On the right-hand side (Your router), open the tmp folder. Lastly, right click the IPK file and choose upload:\n\n\nNote: For Atheros chip, choose 15.05.1\\ar71xx\\generic. For MediaTeck, choose 15.05.1\\ramips\\mt7620. For other chips, please find the similar file name.\n\n\nMT300N \n MT300A: \\15.05.1\\ramips\\mt7620\\ easytether-usb-openssl_0.8.7-1_ramips_24kec.ipk\n\n\nAR150 \n AR300M: \\15.05.1\\ar71xx\\generic\\easytether-usb-openssl_0.8.7-1_ar71xx.ipk\n\n\n\n\n3) Use SSH to install EasyTether driver\n\n\ni.\n Open PuTTY, enter the IP of your router and other information as the figure shown below, then click Open:\n\n\n\n\nii.\n Login by using your username and password of the router (username: root; password: same as the one you need for entering the web interface):\n\n\nNote: The password you entered will not be showed on the screen.\n\n\n\n\niii.\n You can now update the OpenWRT modules (internet connection required) by typing:\n\n\nopkg update\n\n\nHit enter and then it will update automatically.\n\n\nNote: You can skip the update and do it after you have finished tethering.\n\n\niv.\n Install the driver by typing the following command and then hit enter:\n\n\nopkg install /tmp/filename.ipk\n\n\nNote: The filename is the file you uploaded in Procedure A)2.ii.\n\n\nv.\n Type in the following command and hit enter:\n\n\neasytether-usb\n\n\nvi.\n Copy the following command to Putty:\n\n\ncat \n EOF \n /etc/config/network\n\nconfig interface 'wan'\noption ifname 'tap-easytether'\noption proto 'dhcp'\nEOF\n\n\n\n\nNote:  To paste it into Putty, just right click the black screen and then hit enter.\n\n\nvii.\n Type in the following command to reboot your router or unplug the power cable of your router. Afterward, plug in the power cable to turn on the router.\n\n\nreboot -f\n\n\nPreparing your smart phone\n\n\n1) Enable the Developer Options\n\n\ni.\n Go to Setting -\n About Device -\n Software info. Hitting the build number several times and it will announce that you have turn on the Developer Options.\n\n\n\n\nii.\n Go to Setting -\n Developer Options, turn on the Developer Options and also the USB debugging.\n\n\n\n\n2) Start tethering\n\n\ni.\n Open EasyTether App, tick the USB button, it will show \u201cwaiting for connection from the host\u201d. \n\n\n\n\nii.\n Connect your phone to the router via USB cable. Hit OK to allow the USB debugging.\n\n\n\n\niii.\n Your connection has been established.\n\n\n\n\nYou can now connect your device to the router and access the Internet. However, if you are using the lite version of EasyTether app, you will not able to access the website with https like: https://www.youtube.com since this type of secure communication is being blocked by the lite version.",
