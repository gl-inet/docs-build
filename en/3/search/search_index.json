You can compile a firmware with tons of features and writing data is almost instant.\n\n\nBy adding PCIe interface, a 5G 802.11a/ac addon module can be connected and you can enjoy the wifi speed on a mini router.\n\n\nPerformance\n\n\nBy adding a fast Nand flash, you can feel how the performance is improved compared to a Nor flash router.\n\n\nThe performance comparision between AR300M (nand) with AR150 is below:\n\n\n\n\nIt only takes 6 seconds to upload and process 250 ovpn files. When installing packages to the router, it takes no more than 20% for the time spent than using nor flash, including the time to download resource from the Internet. So everything just happends in seconds.\n\n\nBuilding Firmware\n\n\nThe router has two flash so we have two firmwares. One firmware is installed on the Nor flash and one is installed on the nand flash. The two firmware is independent from each other. The router will always try to boot from the nand flash. If it fails for 3 times it will boot from the Nor flash.\n\n\nBy using two firmwares, businesses can have dual boot options to ensure the system can backup, upgrade and boot without problems.\n\n\nBuilding the generic firmware for nor flash\n\n\nThe simple instructions of building the firmware can be found here: https://github.com/gl-inet/lede-17.01\nYou need to have a Linux machine. In this example we use Ubuntu.\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install subversion build-essential git-core libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk flex quilt libssl-dev xsltproc libxml-parser-perl mercurial bzr ecj cvs unzip git wget\n$ git clone https://github.com/domino-team/openwrt-cc.git\n$ cd openwrt-cc\n$ ./scripts/feeds update -a\n$ ./scripts/feeds install -a\n$ make menuconfig\n  ..choose your compile target and packages\n$ make\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to build the firmware for nor flash, choose \nGL-AR300M\n as the target.\n\n\n\n\nBuild the nand firmware for nand flash\n\n\nIf you want to build the firmware for nand flash, first choose subtarget \nGeneric devices with NAND flash\n then choose \nGL-AR300M Nand\n as the target.\n\n\n\n\nThe make process will takes around 1 hour for the first time because it needs to download a lot of data from t he Internet. After compiling finished, you will find the following firmware files in \nbin/ar71xx/\n\n\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-generic-gl-ar300m-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin\n, for nor flash\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-nand-gl-ar300m-squashfs-sysupgrade.tar\n, for nand flash firmware upgrade inside of a working Openwrt firmware\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-nand-gl-ar300m-ubi.img\n, for initial nand flash firmware build, this is used when upgrading using uboot.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThere is two file for nand firmware. The \nxxx-ubi.img\n is used for first time writing to the nand flash. If you are using uboot to upgrade the firmware, please use this one. The \nxxx-sysupgrade.tar\n is used for upgrading from openwrt. So if you use our stock firmware or already using an openwrt firmware, choose this one.\n\n\nUsing Firmware\n\n\nThe firmware has exactly the same UI as our other mini routers. To determine you are using nor flash or nand flash, please check the available space from the UI.\n\n\nControl which firmware you are booting into\n\n\nThere are two methods to control which firmware you can boot.\n\n\nMethod 1: set boot count\n\n\nThe router will always try to boot into the nand firmware. But if it fails for 3 times it will try to boot into the nor firmware. If you want to boot into the nor firmware, you can tell the router that it failed to boot for 3 times already by setting the uboot env. To do so, you can use the following command in a SSH terminal.\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv bootcount 3\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nYou need to do this each time\n if you want to boot into nor firmware, no matter you which firmware you are using. Otherwise after the firmware boot, it will reset \nbootcount\n variable and next boot will always try to boot the nand firmware.\n\n\nMethod 2: using the switch\n\n\nThis is only valid in the new uboot (from Mar 2017).\n\n\nFirst ssh to the router and set uboot env \nboot_dev\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv boot_dev on\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nThen when the router boot, the router will choose which firmware to boot using the hardware switch.\n1. Left side (near the reset button) --\n Nand flash\n2. Right side  --\n Nor flash\n\n\nTo disable using the switch to choose firmware function, clear \nboot_dev\n variable.\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv boot_dev\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nDebrick\n\n\nIf you brick your router and it cannot boot, you can try to save it using uboot.\n\n\nUsing uboot web UI\n\n\nFollow \nthis guide\n for a general instruction to get access of uboot web UI.\n\n\nHere is a video guide for entering AR300M uboot failsafe. \n\n\n\nIn some early version of AR300M, the uboot boot very slowly. So be patient when you press and hold the reset button. The LEDs will start to flash around 5 seconds.\n\n\nThere is a bug in AR300M uboot and in some computers the connection will always reset when you upload firmware.

Cable\n\n\nConnect the router to the modem or main router via Ethernet cable to access the Internet. \n\n\nBefore plugging in the Ethernet cable, you can click \nUse as LAN\n to set the WAN port as a LAN port. That is useful when you are using the router as a \nrepeater\n. As a result, you can have two LAN ports which can be used to connect two devices.\n\n\n\n\nPlug the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router. The information of your connection will be shown on the Cable section. DHCP is the default protocol. You can click \nModify\n to change the protocol.\n\n\n\n\nDHCP\n\n\nDHCP is the default and most common protocol. It doesn't require any manual configuration.\n\n\n\n\nStatic\n\n\nStatic is required if your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided a fixed IP address for you or you want to configure the network information such as IP address, Gateway, Netmask manually.\n\n\nThe current settings will be automatically filled once you choose Static. Change it according to your needs and then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\nPPPoE\n\n\nPPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP).

            "text": "INTERNET\n\n\nThere are total 4 types of connection method that you can use to access the Internet: \nCable\n, \nRepeater\n, \n3G/4G Modem\n and \nTethering\n.\n\n\n\n\nClick \nINTERNET\n to create an Internet connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1) Cable\n\n\nConnect the router to the modem or main router via Ethernet cable to access the Internet. \n\n\nBefore plugging in the Ethernet cable, you can click \nUse as LAN\n to set the WAN port as a LAN port. That is useful when you are using the router as a \nrepeater\n. As a result, you can have two LAN ports which can be used to connect two devices.\n\n\n\n\nPlug the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router. The information of your connection will be shown on the Cable section. DHCP is the default protocol. You can click \nModify\n to change the protocol.\n\n\n\n\nDHCP\n\n\nDHCP is the default and most common protocol. It doesn't require any manual configuration.\n\n\n\n\nStatic\n\n\nStatic is required if your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided a fixed IP address for you or you want to configure the network information such as IP address, Gateway, Netmask manually.\n\n\nThe current settings will be automatically filled once you choose Static. Change it according to your needs and then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\nPPPoE\n\n\nPPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username \n password that you needed when you are creating the Internet connection.\n\n\nUnder PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Repeater\n\n\nUsing Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe.\n\n\nIt works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network.\n\n\nIn Repeater section, click \nScan\n to search for the available wireless networks nearby.\n\n\n\n\nChoose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password.

Once it has been detected, the 3G/4G modem section will be activated and you will be able to set up your USB modem.\n\n\nBe aware that some modems work in host-less mode, which will be configured through \nTethering\n but not 3G/4G modem.\n\n\nIn General, you can set up your 3G/4G modem by the three basic parameters below. Click \nApply\n to connect.\n\n\n\n\nDevice\n: Choose \n/dev/cdc-wdm0\n if your modem supports QMI, otherwise you need to choose \n/dev/ttyUSB\n, which may include several \nttyUSB\n from 0 to 3. You need to choose the correct one based on the modem spec. We suggest you to try \nttyUSB0\n first.\n\n\nService Type\n: This is needed for 3G connection only. For 4G connection, this setting is not necessary.\n\n\nAPN\n: Confirm with your SIM card carrier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Settings:\n\n\n\n\nDial Number\n: Generally, it is a default value and you don't need to set it by yourself. However, if you have this info, please input it.\n\n\nPincode, Username and Password:\n Generally, these informations are not necessary for a unlocked SIM card.

That is useful when you are using the router as a \nrepeater\n. As a result, you can have two LAN ports which can be used to connect two devices.\n\n\n\n\nPlug the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router. The information of your connection will be shown on the Cable section. DHCP is the default protocol. You can click \nModify\n to change the protocol.\n\n\n\n\nDHCP\n\n\nDHCP is the default and most common protocol. It doesn't require any manual configuration.\n\n\n\n\nStatic\n\n\nStatic is required if your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided a fixed IP address for you or you want to configure the network information such as IP address, Gateway, Netmask manually.\n\n\nThe current settings will be automatically filled once you choose Static. Change it according to your needs and then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\nPPPoE\n\n\nPPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username \n password that you needed when you are creating the Internet connection.\n\n\nUnder PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Repeater\n\n\nUsing Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe.\n\n\nIt works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network.\n\n\nIn Repeater section, click \nScan\n to search for the available wireless networks nearby.\n\n\n\n\nChoose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password. You can also enable the \nRemember\n button to save the current chose wireless network. Finally, click \nJoin\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) USB 3G/4G Modem\n\n\nYou can connect to the Internet using a USB 3G/4G modem. Insert your SIM card into the USB modem  Plug the USB modem into the USB port of the router. Once it has been detected, the 3G/4G modem section will be activated and you will be able to set up your USB modem.\n\n\nBe aware that some modems work in host-less mode, which will be configured through \nTethering\n but not 3G/4G modem.\n\n\nIn General, you can set up your 3G/4G modem by the three basic parameters below. Click \nApply\n to connect.\n\n\n\n\nDevice\n: Choose \n/dev/cdc-wdm0\n if your modem supports QMI, otherwise you need to choose \n/dev/ttyUSB\n, which may include several \nttyUSB\n from 0 to 3. You need to choose the correct one based on the modem spec. We suggest you to try \nttyUSB0\n first.\n\n\nService Type\n: This is needed for 3G connection only. For 4G connection, this setting is not necessary.\n\n\nAPN\n: Confirm with your SIM card carrier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Settings:\n\n\n\n\nDial Number\n: Generally, it is a default value and you don't need to set it by yourself. However, if you have this info, please input it.\n\n\nPincode, Username and Password:\n Generally, these informations are not necessary for a unlocked SIM card. However, if you have a locked SIM card, please find these informations from your carrier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is connected when the IP address of your SIM card shows up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompatible Modems\n\n\nHere is a list of supported modems that we had tested before. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\n\n3G/4G\n\n\nTested\n\n\nTested by\n\n\nComments*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuectel EC20-E, EC20-A, EC20-C\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuectel EC25-E, EC25-A, EC25-V, EC25-C\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuectel UC20-E\n\n\n3G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZTE ME909s-821\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei E1550\n\n\n3G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuanwei E3276\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTP-Link MA260\n\n\n3G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZTE M823\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nArnas Risqianto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZTE MF190\n\n\n3G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nArnas Risqianto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei E3372\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nanonymous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPantech UML290VW (Verizon)\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet/steven\n\n\nQMI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPantech UML295 (Verizon)\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet/steven\n\n\nHost-less\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovatel USB551L (Verizon)\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet/steven\n\n\nQMI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerizon U620L (Verizon)\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nHost-less\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*QMI: This modem supports QMI mode.

It is quite risky. Fortunately we have some pre-defined scripts that simplifeis the work.\n\n\nPlase do check using \nprintenv\n to find out the correct filename that the script trying to download. \nFor example, if you want to update uboot for AR150, the uboot file should be named as \nuboot_for_gl-ar150.bin\n and put in your tftp root folder.\n\n\nReplace uboot\n\n\nrun lu\n\n\n\n\nUpdate firmware\n\n\nrun lf\n\n\n\n\nUpdate mac address etc\n\n\nrun lc\n\n\n\n\nErase uboot env variables\n\nBe sure to use the right command for the right model\nFor AR150, Domino AR300, AR300M\n\n\nerase 0x9f040000 +0x10000\nreset\n\n\n\n\nFor 6416\n\n\nerase 0x9f010000 +0x10000\nreset\n\n\n\n\nUboot Web UI\n\n\nUboot has a webUI so that you can save your device without entering uboot console.\n\n\n\n\nCheck \nthis section\n  for how to enter uboot web UI using the reset button.\n\n\nIf you are in uboot console, you can start the WebUI the following command.
