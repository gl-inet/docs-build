This guide provide a simple but useful tool that send your BLE data to MQTT servers, which is the underling mechanism for popular IoT solution. In this guide we will introduce two GL.iNet BLE gateway, GL-X750 Spitz and GL-S1300 Convexa-S which has optional built-in BLE modules and how to use them to forward your BLE data to the cloud based on MQTT protocol. This take GL.iNet GoodCloud and AWS IoT as example. Hardware Required \u00b6 Both GL-X750 and GL-S1300 comes with a Silicon BLE 5.0 module with the following specs. It connects to the main board using UART . The same module support BLE and Zigbee. However you need to change the firmware on the module (not the gateway). There is no way to change the firmware from BLE to Zigbee or vice versa on the air. So you have to select the correct module when you purchase the correct product.

There are two kinds of BLE devices. One kind of BLE device use beacons to send data, e.g a BLE thermometer. Another kind of device need to pair first, e.g. BLE smart watch. For BLE beacon device, you can just scan the beacon and get the data. The data is generally encrypted. It is depends on you to decrypted the data. You can decrypt locally on the gateway or just send the encrypted data to your cloud to decrypt there. For BLE devices that needs to pair first, you need to know how they can pair with the gateway. Generally this is provided by the device maker. There are a lot of devices that accept standard connection so you can pair without problem. A list of compatible devices will be collected and posted here. TBD: a list of compatible BLE device. BLE Tools \u00b6 Both GL-X750 and GL-S1300 come with OpenWrt and our BLE tools. In your current firmware for S1300, there may be a BLE tool which comes with a UI.

Send Data to AWS IoT \u00b6 Amazon AWS IoT is a good choice for business applications. AWS seems to have good security and privacy protection. Here we will give an example of how to send your data to AWS IoT platform. It is a little complicated but still OK for IT specialist. 1. Setting up your AWS IoT environment \u00b6 1) On the Welcome to the AWS IoT Console page, in the navigation pane, choose Manage->Things , then Register a thing . 2) On the Creating AWS IoT things page, choose Create a single thing . 3) On the Create a thing page, in the Name field, type a name for your thing, such as x750 . Choose Next . 4) On the Add a certificate for your thing page, choose Create certificate . This generates an X.509 certificate and key pair. 5) On the Certificate created! page, download your public and private keys, certificate, and root certificate authority (CA): Choose Download for your certificate. Choose Download for your private key. Choose Download for the Amazon root CA. This will display a new web page. Choose RSA 2048 bit key: Amazon Root CA 1 . This opens another web page with the text of the root CA certificate. Copy this text and paste it into a file named Amazon_Root_CA_1.pem . Most web browsers save downloaded files into a Downloads directory. You will copy these files to a different directory when you run the sample applications. Choose Activate to activate the X.509 certificate, and then choose Attach a policy . The RSA 2048 bit key: Amazon Root CA1 download web page: 6) Active your thing Back to the previous site, click \" Activate \", then click \" Done \". 2. Attach Policy \u00b6 1) After you register your thing, you will need to create and attach a new policy to the certificate . 2) Enter a Name for the policy,such as x750_policy, then Advance mode 3) Delete the automatically created policy code, then paste the policy below. { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": [ \"iot:Publish\", \"iot:Subscribe\", \"iot:Connect\", \"iot:Receive\" ], \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Resource\": [ \"*\" ] } ] } 4) Create Policy after you pasted policy code. 5) On the left side, Secure --> Certificates, Select the certificate you just created, Actions --> Attach policy 6) Choose the policy you created(x750_policy) and choose Attach . 3. Config GL.iNet devices to connect to AWS IoT \u00b6 1) Upload your certificate to the router Rename the downloaded certificate files : AmazonRootCA1.pem --> root_CA.crt xxxxxxxxxx.private.pem.key --> client.key xxxxxxxxxx. certificate.pem.crt --> client.crt Windows User use WinScp to transfer these three certificate files to /etc/aws/ on router, please create new folder if you cannot find /etc/aws/ . mkdir /etc/aws/ 2) Update mqtt package on GL.iNet routers. You can check if your router comes with updated MQTT package. If it is not, please upgrade it if you want to use AWS. Download the updated mqtt package , file name is ' gl-mqtt_3.0.37-1_mips_24kc.ipk \u2018 Use WinSCP/SSH to transfer the package to /tmp/ , then delete the old package. opkg remove gl-mqtt --force-depends Then install the package: opkg install gl-mqtt_3.0.37-1_mips_24kc.ipk 3) Setup config file for your router Edit /etc/config/glconfig Add the following code to your glconfig file. config service 'cloud' option enable '1' option sub_topic '/a1rLNyG2VK5/mqtt_demo/user/get' option pub_topic '/sys/a1rLNyG2VK5/mqtt_demo/thing/event/property/post' option service_pride '2' option address 'ssl://xxxxxxxxxxxxxx-ats.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:8883' option clientid 'iotconsole-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx' option log '1' The sample of glconfig file: If you already setup GoodCloud on router before, just add the code at the end of config service 'cloud' option log '1' must be contained in the config file. Note** The topic ARN follows this format: arn:aws:iot:*your-region*:*your-aws-account*:topic/*<your/topic>* For example: arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:topic/my/topic Topics The message broker uses topics to route messages from publishing clients to subscribing clients. The forward slash (/) is used to separate topic hierarchy. Note We do not recommend using personally identifiable information in your topics. The following table lists the wildcards that can be used in the topic filter when you subscribe. Topic Wildcards Wildcard Description # Must be the last character in the topic to which you are subscribing. Works as a wildcard by matching the current tree and all subtrees. For example, a subscription to Sensor/# receives messages published to Sensor/ , Sensor/temp , Sensor/temp/room1 , but not the messages published to Sensor . + Matches exactly one item in the topic hierarchy. For example, a subscription to Sensor/+/room1 receives messages published to Sensor/temp/room1 , Sensor/moisture/room1 , and so on. 4) HTTP: API Endpoints add to router config file The message broker supports clients connecting with the HTTP protocol using a REST API. Clients can publish by sending a POST message to *<AWS IoT Endpoint>*/topics/*<url_encoded_topic_name>*?qos=1\" . At the left side of AWS IoT, Manage -> Things You can find your AWT IoT endpoints at Interact . 5) Connect your devices to AWS IoT Cloud Start connect to AWS Cloud /etc/init.d/gl_mqtt start Restart the mqtt services if its process is running. /etc/init.d/gl_mqtt restart Check mqtt process status ps | grep gl_mqtt 4. MQTT Communication Testing \u00b6 Test->Subscribe to a topic The subscription and publish topics in glconfig file: option sub_topic '/a1rLNyG2VK5/mqtt_demo/user/get' option pub_topic '/sys/a1rLNyG2VK5/mqtt_demo/thing/event/property/post' So the Subscription and Publish topic in AWS IoT Cloud shall be exchanged: Subscription Topic: '/sys/a1rLNyG2VK5/mqtt_demo/thing/event/property/post' Publish topic: '/a1rLNyG2VK5/mqtt_demo/user/get' Try Subscribe to topic , a message published by your router will be received in few seconds. Or Publish topic to your router a message : A message published by AWS IoT Cloud will be received on your router in few seconds. logread Application and Demo \u00b6 Read BLE Thermal Sensor \u00b6 The following demo show how to read data from a thermal sensor, pack the data in JSON format and send to the GoodCloud. #!/usr/bin/sh . /usr/share/libubox/jshn.sh while true do sleep 5 bletool on bletool discovery_type 1 1 bletool discovery 1 1 0 | awk '/0d09536d6172745f426561636f6e02/{print $0; exit}' > /tmp/blesniffer.log bletool end_procedure adv_data=`awk '{print $1}' /tmp/blesniffer.log` date=`date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\"` json_init json_add_string \"api\" \"/user/data\" json_add_object \"data\" json_add_string \"date\" \"$date\" json_add_string \"advertising data\" \"$adv_data\" json_close_object json_close_object data=`json_dump` ubus call mqtt pub \"$data\" rm /tmp/blesniffer.log done","title":"BLE MQTT Bridge"},{"location":"dev/ble2mqtt/#ble-mqtt-bridge","text":"","title":"BLE MQTT Bridge"},{"location":"dev/ble2mqtt/#introduction","text":"Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is widely used for smart home, wearable and IoT sensors.

The forward slash (/) is used to separate topic hierarchy. Note We do not recommend using personally identifiable information in your topics. The following table lists the wildcards that can be used in the topic filter when you subscribe. Topic Wildcards Wildcard Description # Must be the last character in the topic to which you are subscribing. Works as a wildcard by matching the current tree and all subtrees. For example, a subscription to Sensor/# receives messages published to Sensor/ , Sensor/temp , Sensor/temp/room1 , but not the messages published to Sensor . + Matches exactly one item in the topic hierarchy. For example, a subscription to Sensor/+/room1 receives messages published to Sensor/temp/room1 , Sensor/moisture/room1 , and so on. 4) HTTP: API Endpoints add to router config file The message broker supports clients connecting with the HTTP protocol using a REST API.

It should be very quick and finish in minutes. Then you will find uboot_for_gl-inet.bin in bin/ . GL-AR150 uboot modify as IoT devices \u00b6 If you connect IoT addon to AR150's UART, which talks to AR150 using serial. When the IoT addon send some data during uboot boot, it may stop the booting process so you never have the router alive. You need to modify the uboot a little bit so that it can succesffuly boot. Use this code from github https://github.com/domino-team/uboot-domino In this uboot, you need to type gl quickly during uboot boot to enter uboot console. MT300A, MT300N, MT750 \u00b6 MT series routers use a different uboot and different code. Consult us if you need. Using uboot \u00b6 You can use printenv to display the environment variables in uboot. here are some quick guide of how to use uboot. First you need to set up tftp server as above and put your files in tftp root folder. basic uboot command \u00b6 Download file to router (AR150, Domino, 6416 as example) tftp 0x81000000 file.bin Erase some part of flash erase 0x9f050000 +0x10000 Write file to flash cp.b 0x81000000 0x9f050000 0x10000 predefined script \u00b6 Actually it is not easy to use basic uboot command to do everyting. It is quite risky. Fortunately we have some pre-defined scripts that simplifeis the work. Plase do check using printenv to find out the correct filename that the script trying to download. For example, if you want to update uboot for AR150, the uboot file should be named as uboot_for_gl-ar150.bin and put in your tftp root folder. Replace uboot run lu Update firmware run lf Update mac address etc run lc Erase uboot env variables Be sure to use the right command for the right model For AR150, Domino AR300, AR300M erase 0x9f040000 +0x10000 reset For 6416 erase 0x9f010000 +0x10000 reset Uboot Web UI \u00b6 Uboot has a webUI so that you can save your device without entering uboot console. Check this section for how to enter uboot web UI using the reset button. If you are in uboot console, you can start the WebUI the following command. This only works for AR series, not MT series. httpd AR300M Specific \u00b6 AR300M uses dual flash so in uboot there are a lot of things to deal with dual flash.

Cable \u00b6 Connect the router to the modem or main router via Ethernet cable to access the Internet. Note: Before plugging the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router, you can click Use as LAN to set the WAN port as a LAN port. That is useful when you are using the router as a repeater . As a result, you can have one more LAN port. Plug the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router. The information of your connection will be shown on the Cable section. DHCP is the default protocol. You can click Modify to change the protocol. DHCP \u00b6 DHCP is the default and most common protocol. It doesn't require any manual configuration. Static \u00b6 Static is required if your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided a fixed IP address for you or you want to configure the network information such as IP address, Gateway, Netmask manually. The current settings will be automatically filled once you choose Static. Change it according to your needs and then click Apply . PPPoE \u00b6 PPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username & password that you needed when you are creating the Internet connection. Under PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click Apply . 2. Repeater \u00b6 Using Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe. It works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network. In Repeater section, click Scan to search for the available wireless networks nearby. Choose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password. You can also enable the Remember button to save the current chose wireless network. Finally, click Join . 3. USB 3G/4G Modem \u00b6 You can connect to the Internet using a USB 3G/4G modem. Some SIM cards may need to be activated the first time you use them, so please activate them in your phone before using them in your router. We recommend to turn off the router first, insert your SIM card into the USB modem then plug the USB modem into the USB port of the router, and then turn it on again. The first time, when the router is powered on, it may not connect automatically, but it has read the name of your carrier in the upper left corner, and you need to click Auto Setup . After a while, it will be connected. Normally, the second time, when the router is powered on, after a while, it will automatically recognize the SIM card and establish a connection. It may not get the information of signal, modem name and IMEI. If you insert a usb modem at power on, it will not automatically connect. If it shows the carrier name in the upper left corner, you can click Abort . After a while, the button will turn to Auto Setup , then click Auto Setup . If it doesn't show the carrier name, you can click Modem Reset . Please note that there is your carrier name in the upper left corner of it. Click Abort , wait a while, and if it doesn't work, click Modem Reset . You may get into this screen, then you need to click Auto Setup , please note that at this time, there is your carrier name in the upper left corner of it. Wait a moment and it will be connected. Manual Setup \u00b6 Sometimes, Auto Setup may not work, you can try Manual Setup . Device : Choose /dev/cdc-wdm0 if your modem supports QMI, otherwise you need to choose /dev/ttyUSB , which may include several ttyUSB from 0 to 3. You need to choose the correct one based on the modem spec. We suggest you to try ttyUSB0 first. Service Type : Indicate the service type of your SIM card. APN : Confirm with your SIM card carrier.

Cable \u00b6 Connect the router to the modem or main router via Ethernet cable to access the Internet. Note: Before plugging the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router, you can click Use as LAN to set the WAN port as a LAN port. That is useful when you are using the router as a repeater . As a result, you can have one more LAN port. Plug the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router. The information of your connection will be shown on the Cable section. DHCP is the default protocol. You can click Modify to change the protocol. DHCP \u00b6 DHCP is the default and most common protocol. It doesn't require any manual configuration. Static \u00b6 Static is required if your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided a fixed IP address for you or you want to configure the network information such as IP address, Gateway, Netmask manually. The current settings will be automatically filled once you choose Static. Change it according to your needs and then click Apply . PPPoE \u00b6 PPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username & password that you needed when you are creating the Internet connection. Under PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click Apply . 2. Repeater \u00b6 Using Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe. It works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network. In Repeater section, click Scan to search for the available wireless networks nearby. Choose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password. You can also enable the Remember button to save the current chose wireless network. Finally, click Join . 3. USB 3G/4G Modem \u00b6 You can connect to the Internet using a USB 3G/4G modem. Some SIM cards may need to be activated the first time you use them, so please activate them in your phone before using them in your router. We recommend to turn off the router first, insert your SIM card into the USB modem then plug the USB modem into the USB port of the router, and then turn it on again. The first time, when the router is powered on, it may not connect automatically, but it has read the name of your carrier in the upper left corner, and you need to click Auto Setup . After a while, it will be connected. Normally, the second time, when the router is powered on, after a while, it will automatically recognize the SIM card and establish a connection. It may not get the information of signal, modem name and IMEI. If you insert a usb modem at power on, it will not automatically connect. If it shows the carrier name in the upper left corner, you can click Abort . After a while, the button will turn to Auto Setup , then click Auto Setup . If it doesn't show the carrier name, you can click Modem Reset . Please note that there is your carrier name in the upper left corner of it. Click Abort , wait a while, and if it doesn't work, click Modem Reset . You may get into this screen, then you need to click Auto Setup , please note that at this time, there is your carrier name in the upper left corner of it. Wait a moment and it will be connected. Manual Setup \u00b6 Sometimes, Auto Setup may not work, you can try Manual Setup . Device : Choose /dev/cdc-wdm0 if your modem supports QMI, otherwise you need to choose /dev/ttyUSB , which may include several ttyUSB from 0 to 3. You need to choose the correct one based on the modem spec. We suggest you to try ttyUSB0 first. Service Type : Indicate the service type of your SIM card. APN : Confirm with your SIM card carrier. Click More will show advanced Settings: Dial Number : Generally, it is a default value and you don't need to set it manually. However, if you have this info, please input it. Pincode, Username and Password : Generally, these are not necessary for an unlocked SIM card. However, if you have a locked SIM card, please consult your service provider. AT Command \u00b6 The built-in modem supports AT command for the management and configuration of the modem. In 3G/4G Modem section, Click AT Command . Shortcut: There are several pre-configured AT commands that you can use directly. If you want to run your own AT command, choose Manual command . AT Command: The place where you can input AT command. For the list of AT command, please refer to the AT command manual of the built-in modem. Port: The default port for AT command is /dev/ttyUSB2 .

Tethering \u00b6 Using a USB cable to share network from your smartphone to the router is called Tethering. Host-less modem works in Tethering during the setup of the modem as well. For host-less modem tethering, plug it into the USB port of the router. For iPhone tethering: Connect iPhone to the USB port of the router. It will pop up a message asking to trust this computer? Click \"Trust\" to contine. Because we are connecting the iPhone to the router, so here is to TRUST the router. Go to iPhone -> Settings -> Personal Hotspot -> Turn on Allow Others to Join. Go to web Admin Panel, on the left side bar, choose \"INTERNET\" and click \"Connect\" in the middle of the page. It will show connected information on the top of your phone screen and the web Admin Panel once you connect successfully. Tethering connected.

Change it according to your needs and then click Apply . PPPoE \u00b6 PPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username & password that you needed when you are creating the Internet connection. Under PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click Apply . 2. Repeater \u00b6 Using Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe. It works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network. In Repeater section, click Scan to search for the available wireless networks nearby. Choose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password. You can also enable the Remember button to save the current chose wireless network. Finally, click Join . 3. 3G/4G Modem \u00b6 GL-E750 has a built-in 3G/4G modem.

Under PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click Apply . 2. USB 3G/4G Modem \u00b6 You can connect to the Internet using a USB 3G/4G modem. Some SIM cards may need to be activated the first time you use them, so please activate them in your phone before using them in your router. We recommend to turn off the router first, insert your SIM card into the USB modem then plug the USB modem into the USB port of the router, and then turn it on again. The first time, when the router is powered on, it may not connect automatically, but it has read the name of your carrier in the upper left corner, and you need to click Auto Setup . After a while, it will be connected. Normally, the second time, when the router is powered on, after a while, it will automatically recognize the SIM card and establish a connection. It may not get the information of signal, modem name and IMEI. If you insert a usb modem at power on, it will not automatically connect. If it shows the carrier name in the upper left corner, you can click Abort . After a while, the button will turn to Auto Setup , then click Auto Setup .

The setting procedure can be found in section 3.6 Cable configuration and 3.7 Wi-Fi configuration. MQTT X client configuration \u00b6 Before doing the MQTT X client configuration, we need to configure the configuration of the MQTT server on S10 first. Find MQTT Server session in the S10 Tool APP. Here we are using the test MQTT server: iot-s10-test.gl-inet.cn. And the Port is: 1884, so we need to set the Host in the following figure: iot-s10-test.gl-inet.cn. And set Port: 1884. Figure 32 Figure 33 On the windows version of the MQTT X client, start the MQTT X software and add a new connection. To configure the beta cloud platform, enter the URL address iot-s10-test.gl-inet.cn and port 1884. Click the upper right corner of the page to connect. A successful connection is shown below in Figure 33. Figure 34 Figure 35 MQTT Message Editing and Communicating with S10 \u00b6 The default command topic for this firmware is GL-IoT/comTopic/{dev_MAC}, and the command reply topic is GL-IoT/rspTopic/{dev_MAC}. The BLE MAC address of the GL-S10 device we use in this example is: E8DB841E2B1E (The BLE MAC address is printed on the bottom of the device or in the app). In our testing, MQTT X sends data via GL-IoT/comTopic/E8DB841E2B1E and receives data from GL-S10 by subscribing to GL-IoT/rspTopic/E8DB841E2B1E. Below is a demo of how to set data (SET_DEV_MESSAGE) and obtain data from GL-S10 (GET_DEV_MESSAGE): Step 1: Subscribe to the GL-IoT/rspTopic/E8DB841E2B1E topic using MQTT X. Figure 36 Step 2: SET_WIFI_CONFIG API Function: Configure SSID and PWD of WIFI or SSID, user name, user password of WIFI WPA2, and try to connect to the corresponding route. { \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"SET_WIFI_CONFIG\", \"params\": { \"type\":0, \"ssid\": \"Test\", \"pwd\": \"123456\" }, \"id\": 1 } Here we use \"Test\" for the SSID and \"123456\" for the user passward. When type is equal to 0, SSID, PASSWORD can be set. When type is equal to 1, SSID, USERNAME, USERPASSWORD can be set. SSID: route name, length 0 - 32 characters. PWD: route password, length 0 - 64 characters. USERNAME: User name, length 0 - 32 characters. USERPWD: User password, length 0 - 64 characters. Figure 37 Set data successfully: Figure 38 Step 3: GET_WIFI_CONFIG API Function: Get the SSID and PWD of WIFI or SSID, user name, user password of WIFI WPA2\\ { \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" , \"method\" : \"GET_WIFI_CONFIG\" , \"params\" : { \"type\" : 0 }, \"id\" : 2 } When type is equal to 0, get SSID, PASSWORD. When type is equal to 1, get SSID, USERNAME, USERPASSWORD Figure 39 Get data successfully: Figure 40 BLE Data Uploading \u00b6 After successfully establishing connection, GL-S10 automatically enters Scanning mode and scans for BLE signal during startup. If the MQTT server is connected, the BLE scan data will be packaged and uploaded to \"GL-IoT/dataTopic/{dev_MAC}\" topic in JSON format. ({dev_MAC} is the local BLE MAC address, in this example, the BLE MAC address of the GL-S10 device used is: E8DB841E2B1E). As shown above, the JSON fields have the following definitions MAC : Broadcast source address rssi : Broadcast source signal strength n : Broadcast source device name (this field will not appear if the broadcast source does not have a name) ad : Broadcast data advData ts : receive timestamp If you purchased a gateway kit with a BLE Beacon and adds filtering rules for the beacon BLE MAC address according to section 3.9, the JSON information viewed here is the BLE information broadcast by the beacon. The beacons are placed at different distances from the GL-S10 gateway (distance up to the decimeter level), and the value of rssi (broadcast source signal strength) may fluctuate based on distance.

Change it according to your needs and then click Apply . PPPoE \u00b6 PPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username & password that you needed when you are creating the Internet connection. Under PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click Apply . 2. Repeater \u00b6 Using Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe. It works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network. In Repeater section, click Scan to search for the available wireless networks nearby. Choose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password. You can also enable the Remember button to save the current chose wireless network. Finally, click Join . 3. 3G/4G Modem \u00b6 GL-X750 has a built-in 3G/4G modem.

By using 128MB NAND flash, space is not a problem and the writing speed is improved greatly. You can compile a firmware with tons of features and writing data is almost instant. By adding PCIe interface, a 5G 802.11a/ac addon module can be connected and you can enjoy the Wi-Fi speed on a mini router. Performance \u00b6 By adding a fast NAND flash, you can feel how the performance is improved compared to a NOR flash router. The performance comparision between AR300M (NAND) with AR150 is below: It only takes 6 seconds to upload and process 250 ovpn files. When installing packages to the router, it takes no more than 20% for the time spent than using NOR flash, including the time to download resource from the Internet. So everything just happends in seconds. Building Firmware \u00b6 The router has two flash so we have two firmwares. One firmware is installed on the NOR flash and one is installed on the NAND flash. The two firmware is independent from each other. The router will always try to boot from the NAND flash. If it fails for 3 times it will boot from the NOR flash. By using two firmwares, businesses can have dual boot options to ensure the system can backup, upgrade and boot without problems. Building the generic firmware for NOR flash \u00b6 The simple instructions of building the firmware can be found here: https://github.com/gl-inet/lede-17.01 You need to have a Linux machine. In this example we use Ubuntu. $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install subversion build-essential git-core libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk flex quilt libssl-dev xsltproc libxml-parser-perl mercurial bzr ecj cvs unzip git wget $ git clone https://github.com/domino-team/openwrt-cc.git $ cd openwrt-cc $ ./scripts/feeds update -a $ ./scripts/feeds install -a $ make menuconfig ..choose your compile target and packages $ make If you want to build the firmware for NOR flash, choose GL-AR300M as the target. Build the NAND firmware for NAND flash \u00b6 If you want to build the firmware for nand flash, first choose subtarget Generic devices with NAND flash then choose GL-AR300M NAND as the target. The make process will takes around 1 hour for the first time because it needs to download a lot of data from t he Internet. After compiling finished, you will find the following firmware files in bin/ar71xx/ openwrt-ar71xx-generic-gl-ar300m-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin , for NOR flash openwrt-ar71xx-nand-gl-ar300m-squashfs-sysupgrade.tar , for NAND flash firmware upgrade inside of a working Openwrt firmware openwrt-ar71xx-nand-gl-ar300m-ubi.img , for initial NAND flash firmware build, this is used when upgrading using uboot. Note There is two file for NAND firmware. The xxx-ubi.img is used for first time writing to the NAND flash. If you are using uboot to upgrade the firmware, please use this one. The xxx-sysupgrade.tar is used for upgrading from openwrt. So if you use our stock firmware or already using an openwrt firmware, choose this one. Using Firmware \u00b6 The firmware has exactly the same UI as our other mini routers. To determine you are using NOR flash or NAND flash, please check the available space from the APPLICATIONS -> Plug-ins page. Control which firmware you are booting into \u00b6 There are two methods to control which firmware you can boot. Method 1: set boot count \u00b6 The router will always try to boot into the NAND firmware. But if it fails for 3 times it will try to boot into the NOR firmware. If you want to boot into the NOR firmware, you can tell the router that it failed to boot for 3 times already by setting the uboot env. To do so, you can use the following command in a SSH terminal. $ fw_printenv $ fw_setenv bootcount 3 $ reboot You need to do this each time if you want to boot into NOR firmware, no matter you which firmware you are using. Otherwise after the firmware boot, it will reset bootcount variable and next boot will always try to boot the NAND firmware. Method 2: using the switch \u00b6 This is only valid in the new uboot (from Mar 2017). First ssh to the router and set uboot env boot_dev $ fw_printenv $ fw_setenv boot_dev on $ reboot Then when the router boot, the router will choose which firmware to boot using the hardware switch. Left side (near the reset button) --> NAND flash Right side --> NOR flash To disable using the switch to choose firmware function, clear boot_dev variable. $ fw_printenv $ fw_setenv boot_dev $ reboot Debrick \u00b6 If you brick your router and it cannot boot, you can try to save it using uboot. Using uboot web UI \u00b6 Follow this guide for a general instruction to get access of uboot web UI. Here is a video guide for entering AR300M uboot failsafe. In some early version of AR300M, the uboot boot very slowly. So be patient when you press and hold the reset button. The LEDs will start to flash around 5 seconds. There is a bug in AR300M uboot and in some computers the connection will always reset when you upload firmware. Check this post to find the discussion. You can either try chaning the MTU or just try another computer. Note : If you have an older version of uboot, the webUI will only be able to flash NAND flash. This is fixed in newer versions. Note : When flash NAND firmware, only use the firmware with .img in the name, not the one with .rar in the name. The following figure is the web UI of the new uboot. Using uboot console \u00b6 If you want to use uboot console, you need to open the case and solder the serial connectors. Then you need to set up a tftp server. in uboot console, the command to flash NOR flash is run lf to flash NAND firmware is run nlf","title":"GL-AR300M (Shadow)"},{"location":"specification/gl-ar300m/#gl-ar300m-series-shadow","text":"Best Mini Router Ever AR300M is the our best mini router.

This does not work with external USB modems. Q1: SIM card not detected \u00b6 The SIM card does not support hot plugging and play. Make sure that you have inserted the SIM card before powering the 4G router on. This prompt indicates that there is a problem with the contact between SIM card and card slot. You can try the following methods: If you inserted the SIM card after the router is powered on, reboot the 4G router or perform a \"Modem Reset\" from the Router's UI. Check that you have inserted the SIM card in the correct direction. Add a piece of paper to the non-contact surface of SIM card inside of the SIM slot so that the SIM card is contacting well inside the slot. Try another SIM card. Check whether the SIM card slot is damaged and contact customer service through the purchase platform. Q2: SIM card not registered \u00b6 Enter the AT instruction page and execute the command AT+QPRTPARA=3 Wait for about 30 seconds to check whether the device is registered with the network. Some SIM cards need to fill in the correct APN to register the network. In this case, please ignore the prompt information on the page, enter the manual setting page and fill in the correct APN, and click apply. Some SIM cards needs to fill a correct PIN code to register the network. In this case, please choose set up manually, choose ttyUSB3 and input your pin code. Please note: QMI mode does not work with a PIN code. How to get your APN \u00b6 Different types of SIM cards may have different APN settings, so you can check with your local operator for the correct APN settings. Q3: Auto Setup failed \u00b6 Auto Setup will try all the possible methods to build a connection. In case Auto Setup fails to connect, please try manually setting and selecting the appropriate connection protocol. Use the QMI protocol \u00b6 Select device as /dev/cdc-wdmX and fill in the correct APN . Use PPPD dial \u00b6 Select device as /dev/ttyUSBX and fill in the correct APN . X is a number, and in general, select the port with the largest value. For MIFI,E750,X750,X300B , select ttyUSB3 . For XE300 and AP1300 , select ttyUSB4 . Use the QCM protocol \u00b6 QCM protocol is supported in versions after 3.200. Please select device as /dev/cdc-wdmX , fill in the correct [ APN ) settings, and then click More to select protocol as QCM Q4: Data throughput is low \u00b6 If you have successfully set up the 4G router but the data throughput is low, for example, when testing with speedtest.net, here is what you can try to dragonize the problem. Please note: generally the 4G router cannot beat your smartphone in speed test. This is because the modern smartphone uses a different design which is equipped with much higher grade of modems. For example, Samsung S10 has a Cat 20 modem and iPhone 11 has a Cat 19 modem. They are 6 times faster in specs than a Cat 6 Quectel EP06 modem. Try to use QMI or QCM protocol instead of using ttyUSB mode. Ask your carrier to make sure the APN Settings are correct. Some carriers use different APNs which may yield different speed. The signal may not be good. Click Cell Info to check the signal-related parameters, such as RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ,SINR, etc. Please refer to the wiki for parameter range determination. If the device's signal is poor, try moving the device to another location and check that the antenna is properly connected. Bandwidth also affects the rate. For example, when routers were working on Band5, the band5 supported only 10M bandwidth at most, and routers acquired a lower rate. In LTE mode, the bandwidth of each band is as follows, which is a parameter that 3GPP has already defined, so there is no way to change it. Q5: EP06 cannot work at 4G+ \u00b6 Some customers may encounter the situation that the mobile phone can work in 4G+ mode, but the router using EP06 cannot work in 4G+ mode.

Please note: generally the 4G router cannot beat your smartphone in speed test. This is because the modern smartphone uses a different design which is equipped with much higher grade of modems. For example, Samsung S10 has a Cat 20 modem and iPhone 11 has a Cat 19 modem. They are 6 times faster in specs than a Cat 6 Quectel EP06 modem. Try to use QMI or QCM protocol instead of using ttyUSB mode. Ask your carrier to make sure the APN Settings are correct. Some carriers use different APNs which may yield different speed. The signal may not be good. Click Cell Info to check the signal-related parameters, such as RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ,SINR, etc. Please refer to the wiki for parameter range determination. If the device's signal is poor, try moving the device to another location and check that the antenna is properly connected. Bandwidth also affects the rate. For example, when routers were working on Band5, the band5 supported only 10M bandwidth at most, and routers acquired a lower rate. In LTE mode, the bandwidth of each band is as follows, which is a parameter that 3GPP has already defined, so there is no way to change it.","title":"Q4: Data throughput is low"},{"location":"troubleshooting/modem_faq/#q5-ep06-cannot-work-at-4g","text":"Some customers may encounter the situation that the mobile phone can work in 4G+ mode, but the router using EP06 cannot work in 4G+ mode.

Site to Site \u00b6 Introduction \u00b6 Site to Site allows offices in multiple locations to establish secure connections with each other over internet. It extends the company's network, making computers resources from one location available to employees at other locations. Senerio 1: A company has dozens of branch offices that they wish to join in a single private network to share resources. Senerio 2: A company has a close relationship with a partner company, the Site to Site allows the companies to work together in a secure, shared network environment. Senerio 3: A family has IP camera and when they are not at home, the Site to Site allows to remote access the IP camera. Conditions \u00b6 It requires at least two routers, each in a different location, one of which has a public IP address. Please check if your ISP assigns you a public IP address . It requires firmware version 3.026 and above. Note: It is not recommended to run Site to Site while its nodes are also running VPN client, which can make the network particularly complex. Steps to build a Site to Site network \u00b6 Bind your routers to GoodCloud. ( how? ) Follow the steps below to create a Site to Site network. Default port is 51830, if you want to use another port, find the Advanced option at the lower left corner. Due to the device's performance, each Site to Site network can have up to 10 devices. After you had chosen the devices, click Continue. Then, it will test each device if it can be set as the Main Node of Site to Site. We suggest that the router with strong performance and best network speed to be the Main Node. If none of the devices can be used as the Main Node, make sure that: One of routers has a public IP, either static public IP or dynamic public IP. Port is open, default is 51830. If the router is behind NAT, you may need to set up port forwading. You can also change port and try again. If there are more than one device can be set as the Main Node, you need to choose one to continue. If there is only one device can be set as the Main Node, it will go to the Site to Site detail page directly. The network is stopped by default, check the LAN IP, if it is OK then you need to click Start button, otherwise click Setting to change LAN IP. Wait a few minutes, the node's connect status will display as lines. Solid line means connected, dashed line means disconnected. Testing the Site to Site connection \u00b6 Now the Site to Site network is created and started, let's test the connection. Use your PC or Phone to connect to one of the Node of this Site to Site, and use browser to access another Node's LAN ip, if you see the login page, the connection between these two nodes is worked. For example, my PC connect to Node 1 device, and then I use browser to access Main Node's LAN IP (192.168.48.1), if I see the login page, it means the connection between Node1 and Main Node is worked. Route and other options \u00b6 You can change each device's LAN IP and routes. By default, each node can access other's LAN, based on security, we recommend only open the corresponding service IPs. E.g. There is a Server A(172.30.97.100) in Node 1's subnet, if you want other Site to Site nodes only can access Node 1's Service A, you can set it like below: You can add node's parent routes too. Each sub Node build an encrypted tunnel netwrok to Main Node, if you want to change the IP of tunnel subnet. Click 'IP Address Range'. Batch Setting \u00b6 You can use this feature to configure multiple parameters for a single device, or you can configure multiple parameters for multiple devices. Note: This feature is only available to business users. Batch Setting of Single Device \u00b6 To configure single device, as show below. The left side of image below is correct. If your interface is like the right side of image below, please upgrade to latest testing firmware. Check the configuration that needs to be modified and input value. The checked configuration is required, and only the configuration that conforms to the rule can be filled out. After the configuration is delivered, it does not take effect immediately. The configuration takes effect and the device needs to be restarted. You can check the Restart now option in the lower right corner of the above figure. After the configuration is completed, the device will restart immediately. Preview the configuration and confirm the delivery. Unchecked Restart now option will prompt. Batch Setting of Mutiple Devices \u00b6 Select the devices you want to configure. Other operations are the same as when operating a single device. Other Batch Operations \u00b6 Other Batch Operations: Move to other group, upgrade, restart, delete. Template Management \u00b6 Save frequently used configurations as templates and quickly apply them when you modify configurations in batches. Note: This feature is only available to business users. Add a Template \u00b6 Check the configuration that needs to be modified and input value. Most of the options are the same as those on web Admin Panel. Upgrade \u00b6 Upgrade Path is for upgrading custom firmware. Put the firmware and a text file on a web server, then put the url path on the Upgrade Path . For example, https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/ is a Upgrade Path, it has a list-sha256.txt file https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/list-sha256.txt and a corresponding firmware file https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/openwrt-ar750-3.203-0701.bin . Note: GL-AX1800, GL-S1300, GL-B1300, GL-AP1300 only support http path for now. The content of the text file is like this , its name should be list-sha256.txt . It has 4 columns, the first column is firmware version, the second column is the name of firmware file, the thrid column is the sha256 of firmware file, the forth column is the size of firmware file. Give the template a name and description. Apply a template to a router \u00b6 If you have created a template, then want to apply this template to a router. On the Device List page, find the router that you want to apply the template, make sure it is online, on the Actions column, click the cog icon, click Modify Configuration item. It will pop up a dialog Configure batch modification . On the top right corner of the dialog, you can choose a template that has already created. Then click Apply button on the bottom right corner. It will pop up another dialog to review the configuration of the template, scroll down to the bottom to click the Confirm button, it will load the configuration of template overwrite to this time modification. Click Apply button, please note that the router will restart to take effect after click the Apply button. Apply a template to multiple routers \u00b6 If you have created a template, then want to apply this template to multiple routers. This procedure is similar to that applied to a single router. On the Device List page, multiple select routers, then click Bulk Action , click Modify Configuration item. It will pop up a dialog Configure batch modification . On the top right corner of the dialog, you can choose a template that has already created. Then click Apply button on the bottom right corner. It will pop up another dialog to review the configuration of the template, scroll down to the bottom to click the Confirm button, it will load the configuration of template overwrite to this time modification. Click Apply button, please note that the router will restart to take effect after click the Apply button. Task List \u00b6 At task list page, it shows the execution result of the configuration template. Note: This feature is only available to business users. You can view the execution result of each device and configuration. BLE MQTT Bridge \u00b6 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is widely used for smart home, wearable and IoT sensors. This feature is for GL.iNet BLE gateway, GL-X750 Spitz and GL-S1300 convexa S which has built-in BLE modules. Read this to learn how to use them forward your BLE data to the cloud based on MQTT protocol, including GL.iNet GoodCloud and AWS IoT. GoodCloud and VPN \u00b6 If you enable GoodCloud feature on router and also use it as VPN client, there is something important you need to know. At default, GoodCloud process use VPN if you enable VPN client(eg. WireGuard, OpenVPN), this bring a problem that if you VPN is configured incorrectly, GoodCloud will not work properly. In order to ensure the normal use of GoodCloud, we suggest you to follow the steps below to enable VPN Policies and disable \"Use VPN for all process on the router\". After you've done these steps, GoodCloud precess will not use VPN. It is not recommended to run Site to Site while its nodes are also running VPN client, which can make the network particularly complex. Turn off cloud \u00b6 To stop GoodCloud service, turn it off on router web Admin Panel. Please follow the steps below. No action needed on the GoodCloud website. After disable Cloud, the interface is like above.","title":"Cloud"},{"location":"tutorials/cloud/#glinet-goodcloud","text":"","title":"GL.iNet GoodCloud"},{"location":"tutorials/cloud/#contents","text":"Introduction Setup Enable Cloud Management on web Admin Panel Sign up GoodCloud account Select server region Add a new group Add device Auto discover Manually add Bulk import Binded info on router web Admin Panel Unbind router Manage your devices Devices info and status LTE Signal Device detail info Remote access web Admin Panel Remote access router's terminal Set email alarm Site to Site Introduction Conditions Steps to build a Site to Site network Testing the Site to Site connection Route and other options Batch Setting Batch Setting of Single Device Batch Setting of Mutiple Devices Other Batch Operations Template Management Add a Template Upgrade Apply a template to a router Apply a template to multiple routers Task List BLE MQTT Bridge GoodCloud and VPN Turn off cloud","title":"Contents"},{"location":"tutorials/cloud/#introduction","text":"GL.iNet GoodCloud cloud management service provide an easy and simple way to remotely access and manage routers.

Click Install to continue. After installed, it will share via LAN by default. Share via LAN : Share the contents of the external storage device with all connected clients. Share via WAN : The contents of the external storage device can be accessed from the WAN. Writable : The contents of the external storage device can be edited. For writable, it recommend using NTFS or EXT4 file systems. Access the storage device \u00b6 You can access the contents of the external storage device from your computer or smart phone. Please check the following guidance for the using of file sharing among different operating systems. General Notes \u00b6 You may be able to access the share via \\\\192.168.8.1\\ or smb://192.168.8.1/ or with GL-modelXXX instead of 192.168.8.1 (eg \\\\GL-AR750S\\ ) in your system's file explorer. Since sharing is enabled to the LAN by default (this includes both wired AND wireless clients) and maps a \"bad user\" to Guest, then even if they don't supply a username and password or an invalid one, ANYONE connected to your router can access the files in the share in Read-Only mode. If you enable Writable mode this applies to both Guests AND the default root user. If you enable write access, anybody can create or delete files and folders, if you disable write access, not even the root user can delete them via SMB (they can through the CLI though). We can hope that in a future revision there is a simple user management and that a named user (or root ) can read and/or write while Guests are limited by the Writable or a Public Write flag on a share (and having multiple shares would be great as well). Windows \u00b6 Method 1: Samba 2.0 (SMB2.0) Support: \u00b6 We suggest Samba 2.0 support for Windows 10 users. Due to the security vulunerabilitiy of the Samba1.0 protocol, Samba1.0 is not enabled by default in Window 10. You may modify the router Samba configuration. 1). SSH into your router, you can gain control of both the router and the network that the rotuer is controlling. 2). Modify the Samba configuration file, type the following command: sed -i 's/security = share/security = user/' /etc/samba/smb.conf.template 3). Restart the Samba service, type the following command: /etc/init.d/samba restart 4). Open 'This PC' and type \\\\your router IP Address , such as \\\\192.168.8.1 . 5). You can view files in your USB flash drive through GL.iNet router now. Method 2: Samba 1.0 (SMB1.0) Support: \u00b6 1) Your network must be Home/Private. Otherwise you may not be able to see your router in Network . 3.0 firmware supports SMB2, and if you need SMB3, use WinSCP to router , edit /etc/samba/smb.conf.template . Change the \"max protocol = SMB2\" to \"min protocol = SMB1\" \"max protocol = SMB3\", then save and exit WinSCP. If you are using Windows 10, you also need to enable SMB 1.0. Windows 7 Go to Control panel -> Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center. Find if your active network is Home network . If not, click it and change it to Home network . Windows 10 Change your network to private by this tutorial . Go to Control Panel -> Programs and Features -> Turn Windows features on or off -> Find SMB 1.0/CIFS file sharing support, check all SMB1 related items, click apply and restart your computer. 2) Open a Windows explorer, you can find Network in the folder directory. Double click your router to access its contents. Mac OS \u00b6 Method 1 1) Open Finder, Menu -> Go -> Connect to Server... 2) Input smb://192.168.8.1 , you need to change this if your router IP address is not 192.168.8.1 3) Click Connect. 4) Input username and password, they are the same when you login web Admin Panel. 5) Then Finder will display files of USB disk. Method 2 1) Go to System Preferences -> Sharing -> File sharing. Click Options and then enable SMB. 2) Open Finder. You should be able to find your router under Shared. iOS \u00b6 You have to use file manage app to access the contents of your external storage device. You may use FE File Explorer : 1) Click + to create a Windows connection. 2) Enter the IP address of your router (192.168.8.1). The User Name is root and the Password is the one that you use to login the web Admin Panel. Finally, click Save . 3) Click your newly created connection to access the contents. Linux \u00b6 If you are using Linux you are probably comfortable with connecting to servers, and how to do this can vary greatly from distribution to distribution and largely depends on your window manager/display environment. Most systems come with Gnome and it is the default on the very popular Ubuntu distribution, so we'll give an example using the Files tool (also called Nautilus). If you open the app you should have a \"Connect to server\" option, there you can enter either the \\\\servername\\share or smb://servername/share format. ChromeOS or ChromiumOS (Neverware CloudReady and others) \u00b6 There is a built in Samba/SMB client in the Files app, and they have deprecated the previous separate plugin/service that was a GoogleLabs experiment. In the Files app if you go to the 3 dot menu at the top right and \"Add new service\" you then select \"SMB File Share\" from the list and it will give you the dialog to fill out with the server name and some other details, but only the server name/IP and share name are required (unless you modify the smb.conf on your router to better control access to certain paths, you can use SSH or Luci + webmin to manage this). The default share name appears to be GL-Samba so a connection string might be \\\\192.168.8.1\\GL-Samba if your USB or microSD is properly recognized. If you are having trouble getting connected or don't know the share name you can check with smbclient which you can install in the Terminal app, which is the interface for Crostini (aka Linux apps in most of the Settings menus). sudo apt update && sudo apt install smbclient # Answer 'y' to the prompt and hit Enter smbclient -N -L 192.168.8.1 Android \u00b6 Most Android devices have file manager tool which maybe can be used to access the files on Network Devices using SMB. Or you can search file explorer app which support SMB on Google Play. Here I'm going to use Solid Explorer File Manager as an example: 1) Open the app. 2) Click the Plus sign button on the right bottom of page, then choose New cloud connection . 3) Choose LAN / SMB . 4) Choose the Server, the IP address of your device. 5) Choose Guest . 6) Choose Yes . 7) Choose SMB 1 . 8) Click NEXT .","title":"File Sharing"},{"location":"tutorials/file_sharing/#file-sharing-on-glinet-routers","text":"You can use GL.iNet routers with external storage device such as USB stick, MicroSD card, etc, and some models have big internal storage, thus the contents can be shared among all your connected clients.

Intro \u00b6 There is several reasons you need to share your smartphone's data to your router: Carriers give you a plan with plenty of data but actually you don't need that much. 4G speed is quite fast and it beats your home Internet speed. You can use the data for your laptop. Using your phone as a hotspot directly is easy, but you cannot connect too many devices. It is very easy to share your data to GL.iNet mini router using router's control interfaces, but in some phone and carrier network, they limit sharing data directly, so you can try EasyTether. We will use Android OS and GL.iNet mini router to demonstrate the procedure.
