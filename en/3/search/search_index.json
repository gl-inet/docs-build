When installing packages to the router, it takes no more than 20% for the time spent than using nor flash, including the time to download resource from the Internet. So everything just happends in seconds.\n\n\nBuilding Firmware\n\n\nThe router has two flash so we have two firmwares. One firmware is installed on the Nor flash and one is installed on the nand flash. The two firmware is independent from each other. The router will always try to boot from the nand flash. If it fails for 3 times it will boot from the Nor flash.\n\n\nBy using two firmwares, businesses can have dual boot options to ensure the system can backup, upgrade and boot without problems.\n\n\nBuilding the generic firmware for nor flash\n\n\nThe simple instructions of building the firmware can be found here: https://github.com/gl-inet/lede-17.01\nYou need to have a Linux machine. In this example we use Ubuntu.\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install subversion build-essential git-core libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk flex quilt libssl-dev xsltproc libxml-parser-perl mercurial bzr ecj cvs unzip git wget\n$ git clone https://github.com/domino-team/openwrt-cc.git\n$ cd openwrt-cc\n$ ./scripts/feeds update -a\n$ ./scripts/feeds install -a\n$ make menuconfig\n  ..choose your compile target and packages\n$ make\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to build the firmware for nor flash, choose \nGL-AR300M\n as the target.\n\n\n\n\nBuild the nand firmware for nand flash\n\n\nIf you want to build the firmware for nand flash, first choose subtarget \nGeneric devices with NAND flash\n then choose \nGL-AR300M Nand\n as the target.\n\n\n\n\nThe make process will takes around 1 hour for the first time because it needs to download a lot of data from t he Internet. After compiling finished, you will find the following firmware files in \nbin/ar71xx/\n\n\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-generic-gl-ar300m-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin\n, for nor flash\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-nand-gl-ar300m-squashfs-sysupgrade.tar\n, for nand flash firmware upgrade inside of a working Openwrt firmware\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-nand-gl-ar300m-ubi.img\n, for initial nand flash firmware build, this is used when upgrading using uboot.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThere is two file for nand firmware. The \nxxx-ubi.img\n is used for first time writing to the nand flash. If you are using uboot to upgrade the firmware, please use this one. The \nxxx-sysupgrade.tar\n is used for upgrading from openwrt. So if you use our stock firmware or already using an openwrt firmware, choose this one.\n\n\nUsing Firmware\n\n\nThe firmware has exactly the same UI as our other mini routers. To determine you are using nor flash or nand flash, please check the available space from the UI.\n\n\nControl which firmware you are booting into\n\n\nThere are two methods to control which firmware you can boot.\n\n\nMethod 1: set boot count\n\n\nThe router will always try to boot into the nand firmware. But if it fails for 3 times it will try to boot into the nor firmware. If you want to boot into the nor firmware, you can tell the router that it failed to boot for 3 times already by setting the uboot env. To do so, you can use the following command in a SSH terminal.\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv bootcount 3\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nYou need to do this each time\n if you want to boot into nor firmware, no matter you which firmware you are using. Otherwise after the firmware boot, it will reset \nbootcount\n variable and next boot will always try to boot the nand firmware.\n\n\nMethod 2: using the switch\n\n\nThis is only valid in the new uboot (from Mar 2017).\n\n\nFirst ssh to the router and set uboot env \nboot_dev\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv boot_dev on\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nThen when the router boot, the router will choose which firmware to boot using the hardware switch.\n1. Left side (near the reset button) --\n Nand flash\n2. Right side  --\n Nor flash\n\n\nTo disable using the switch to choose firmware function, clear \nboot_dev\n variable.\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv boot_dev\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nDebrick\n\n\nIf you brick your router and it cannot boot, you can try to save it using uboot.\n\n\nUsing uboot web UI\n\n\nFollow \nthis guide\n for a general instruction to get access of uboot web UI.\n\n\nHere is a video guide for entering AR300M uboot failsafe. \n\n\n\nIn some early version of AR300M, the uboot boot very slowly. So be patient when you press and hold the reset button. The LEDs will start to flash around 5 seconds.\n\n\nThere is a bug in AR300M uboot and in some computers the connection will always reset when you upload firmware. Check \nthis post\n to find the discussion. You can either try chaning the MTU or just try another computer.\n\n\nNote\n: If you have an older version of uboot, the webUI will only be able to flash NAND flash. This is fixed in newer versions.\n\n\nNote\n: When flash NAND firmware, only use the firmware with \n.img\n in the name, not the one with \n.rar\n in the name.\n\n\nThe following figure is the web ui of the \nnew\n uboot.\n\n\n\n\nUsing uboot console\n\n\nIf you want to use uboot console, you need to open the case and solder the serial connectors.\n\n\nThen you need to set up a tftp server.\n\n\nin uboot console, the command to flash nor flash is \nrun lf\n to flash nand firmware is \nrun nlf",

That is useful when you are using the router as a \nrepeater\n. As a result, you can have one more LAN port.\n\n\n\n\nPlug the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router. The information of your connection will be shown on the Cable section. DHCP is the default protocol. You can click \nModify\n to change the protocol.\n\n\n\n\nDHCP\n\n\nDHCP is the default and most common protocol. It doesn't require any manual configuration.\n\n\n\n\nStatic\n\n\nStatic is required if your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided a fixed IP address for you or you want to configure the network information such as IP address, Gateway, Netmask manually.\n\n\nThe current settings will be automatically filled once you choose Static. Change it according to your needs and then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\nPPPoE\n\n\nPPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username \n password that you needed when you are creating the Internet connection.\n\n\nUnder PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Repeater\n\n\nUsing Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe.\n\n\nIt works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network.\n\n\nIn Repeater section, click \nScan\n to search for the available wireless networks nearby.\n\n\n\n\nChoose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password. You can also enable the \nRemember\n button to save the current chose wireless network. Finally, click \nJoin\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) USB 3G/4G Modem\n\n\nYou can connect to the Internet using a USB 3G/4G modem. Insert your SIM card into the USB modem  Plug the USB modem into the USB port of the router. Once it has been detected, the 3G/4G modem section will be activated and you will be able to set up your USB modem.\n\n\nBe aware that some modems work in host-less mode, which will be configured through \nTethering\n but not 3G/4G modem.\n\n\nClick \nAuto Setup\n to create the connection.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also click \nManual Setup\n to set up manually.\n\n\nIn General, you can set up by the three basic parameters below. Click \nApply\n to connect.\n\n\n\n\nDevice\n: Choose \n/dev/cdc-wdm0\n if your modem supports QMI, otherwise you need to choose \n/dev/ttyUSB\n, which may include several \nttyUSB\n from 0 to 3. You need to choose the correct one based on the modem spec. We suggest you to try \nttyUSB0\n first.\n\n\nService Type\n: Indicate the service type of your SIM card.\n\n\nAPN\n: Confirm with your SIM card carrier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore:\n\n\n\n\nDial Number\n: Generally, it is a default value and you don't need to set it manually.

That is useful when you are using the router as a \nrepeater\n. As a result, you can have one more LAN port.\n\n\n\n\nPlug the Ethernet cable into the ethernet port of the docking station which is connected to the router. The information of your connection will be shown on the Cable section. DHCP is the default protocol. You can click \nModify\n to change the protocol.\n\n\n\n\nDHCP\n\n\nDHCP is the default and most common protocol. It doesn't require any manual configuration.\n\n\n\n\nStatic\n\n\nStatic is required if your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided a fixed IP address for you or you want to configure the network information such as IP address, Gateway, Netmask manually. Change it according to your needs and then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\nPPPoE\n\n\nPPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username \n password that you needed when you are creating the Internet connection.\n\n\nUnder PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Repeater\n\n\nUsing Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe.\n\n\nIt works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network.\n\n\nIn Repeater section, click \nScan\n to search for the available wireless networks nearby.\n\n\n\n\nChoose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password. You can also enable the \nRemember\n button to save the current chose wireless network. Finally, click \nJoin\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) 3G/4G Modem\n\n\nMudi has a built-in 3G/4G modem which you can insert your SIM card directly. Please insert the SIM card before powering on the router. Then, you should find the name of your carrier, click \nAuto Setup\n to create the connection.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also click \nManual Setup\n to set up manually.\n\n\nIn General, you can set up by the three basic parameters below. Click \nApply\n to connect.\n\n\n\n\nDevice\n: Please choose \n/dev/cdc-wdm0 (qmi)\n or \n/dev/ttyUSB3\n.\n\n\nService Type\n: indicate the service of your SIM card.\n\n\nAPN\n: Confirm with your SIM card carrier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Settings:\n\n\n\n\nDial Number\n: Generally, it is a default value and you don't need to set it manually. However, if you have this info, please input it.\n\n\nPincode, Username and Password:\n Generally, these are not necessary for an unlocked SIM card. However, if you have a locked SIM card, please consult your service provider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is connected when the IP address of your SIM card shows up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAT Command\n\n\nThe built-in modem supports AT command for the management and configuration of the modem. In 3G/4G Modem section, Click \nAT Command\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShortcut:\n There are several pre-configured AT commands that you can use directly. If you want to run your own AT command, choose \nManual command\n.\n\n\nAT Command:\n The place where you can input AT command. For the list of AT command, please refer to the AT command manual of the built-in modem.\n\n\nPort:\n The default port for AT command is \n/dev/ttyUSB2\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4) Tethering\n\n\nUsing a USB cable to share network from your smartphone to the router is called Tethering. Host-less modem works in Tethering during the setup of the modem as well.\n\n\nFor host-less modem tethering, plug it into the USB port of the router.\n\n\nFor iPhone tethering, connect it to the USB port of the router and go to Settings-\nPersonal Hotspot-\nAllow Others to Join, then click \nTrust\n to continue when the message pops up in your iPhone.(If the connection is failed please uncheck and check again allow Others to Join)\n\n\nFor Android phone tethering, connect it to the USB port of the router then check Settings-\nPersonal hotspot-\nUsb network sharing.\n\n\nAfter plugging in your device, the Tethering section will update and your device will be shown on the device list. The device name will begin with \neth\n or \nusb\n such as \neth2\n, \nusb0\n. Choose your device and click \nConnect\n.\n\n\n\n\nEasyTether\n\n\nSome carriers prohibit the sharing of the data so that you may not be able to use tethering. However, you can try \neasytethering\n. \n\n\nNote: Easytether is not a free service and we have no affiliation with them.",

Using MQTT, it can forward BLE messages to the cloud and on the other hand forward messages from cloud to the connected BLE device through BLE notify.  \n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\nGL-S10 provide a BLE instructions set. Send commands and messages by writting GATT characteriscs , and get responses or messages from BLE notification.\n\nFollowing is the steps to use this gateway.\n\n\n1. Scan and connect\n\n\nThe gateway act as a GATT server and broadcast itself once power-on. Its name is \"GL-S10\".\nFirstly start the BLE scan and search the name \"GL-S10\" using your BLE device, then connect to it.\n\n\n2.

That is useful when you are using the router as a \nrepeater\n. As a result, you can have one more LAN port.\n\n\n\n\nPlug the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router. The information of your connection will be shown on the Cable section. DHCP is the default protocol. You can click \nModify\n to change the protocol.\n\n\n\n\nDHCP\n\n\nDHCP is the default and most common protocol. It doesn't require any manual configuration.\n\n\n\n\nStatic\n\n\nStatic is required if your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided a fixed IP address for you or you want to configure the network information such as IP address, Gateway, Netmask manually. Change it according to your needs and then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\nPPPoE\n\n\nPPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username \n password that you needed when you are creating the Internet connection.\n\n\nUnder PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Repeater\n\n\nUsing Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe.\n\n\nIt works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network.\n\n\nIn Repeater section, click \nScan\n to search for the available wireless networks nearby.\n\n\n\n\nChoose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password. You can also enable the \nRemember\n button to save the current chose wireless network. Finally, click \nJoin\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) 3G/4G Modem\n\n\nGL-AP1300LTE has a built-in 3G/4G modem which you can insert your SIM card directly. Please insert the SIM card before powering on the router. Then, you should find the name of your carrier, click \nAuto Setup\n to create the connection.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also click \nManual Setup\n to set up manually.\n\n\nIn General, you can set up by the three basic parameters below. Click \nApply\n to connect.\n\n\n\n\nDevice\n: Please choose \n/dev/cdc-wdm0 (qmi)\n or \n/dev/ttyUSB3\n.\n\n\nService Type\n: indicate the service of your SIM card.\n\n\nAPN\n: Confirm with your SIM card carrier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Settings:\n\n\n\n\nDial Number\n: Generally, it is a default value and you don't need to set it manually. However, if you have this info, please input it.\n\n\nPincode, Username and Password:\n Generally, these are not necessary for an unlocked SIM card. However, if you have a locked SIM card, please consult your service provider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is connected when the IP address of your SIM card shows up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompatible Modems\n\n\nHere is a list of supported modems that we had tested before. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\n\n3G/4G\n\n\nTested\n\n\nTested by\n\n\nComments*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuectel EC20-E, EC20-A, EC20-C\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuectel EC25-E, EC25-A, EC25-V, EC25-C\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuectel UC20-E\n\n\n3G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZTE ME909s-821\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei E1550\n\n\n3G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei E3276\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTP-Link MA260\n\n\n3G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZTE M823\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nArnas Risqianto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZTE MF190\n\n\n3G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nArnas Risqianto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei E3372\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nanonymous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPantech UML290VW (Verizon)\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet/steven\n\n\nQMI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPantech UML295 (Verizon)\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet/steven\n\n\nHost-less\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovatel USB551L (Verizon)\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet/steven\n\n\nQMI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerizon U620L (Verizon)\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nHost-less\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*QMI: This modem supports QMI mode.

Therefore, choosing the time zone of your location is recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAC Clone\n\n\nClone the MAC address of your current client to the router. It is used especially in hotel when the network checks your MAC address. For example, if you got your smartphone registered on the network, you can clone the MAC address of your smartphone to the router so that the router can also connect to the network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom DNS Server\n\n\nYou can configure the DNS server of the router in order to prevent DNS leak or other purposes.\n\n\nDNS Rebinding Attack Protection\n: Some network may require authentication in captive portal. Disable this option if the captive portal of your network cannot be resolved.\n\n\nOverride DNS Settings for All Clients\n: Enabling this option will capture DNS request from all connected clients.\n\n\nDNS over TLS from Cloudflare\n: Cloudflare DNS over TLS uses the TLS security protocol for encrypting DNS queries, which helps increase privacy and prevent eavesdropping.\n\n\nManual DNS Server Settings\n: Input a custom DNS server manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Mode\n\n\nChange the network mode to cater your usage scenario. You may need to reconnect your client device whenever you change the network mode of the router.\n\n\nBe aware that you may not be able to access the web Admin Panel with the default IP 192.168.8.1 if you use the router in \nAccess Point\n, \nExtender\n or \nWDS\n mode.

Modify its content and change the TFTP_DIRECTORY to your folder which will contains your files.\n\n\nTFTP_USERNAME=\nTFTP\n\nTFTP_DIRECTORY=\n/tftpboot\n\nTFTP_ADDRESS=\n[::]:69\n\nTFTP_OPTIONS=\n--secure\n\n\n\n\n\nSometime the service cannot be started because network is not available when it starts. Start the service manually.\n\n\nsudo service tftpd-hpa restart\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nDownload service edition of tftpd from http://tftpd32.jounin.net/tftpd32_download.html, then install it.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn off windows firewall, which is the main reason causing tftpd failed to connect.\n\n\n \n\n\nRun tftpd64_SE Admin, choose your tftpd root (in this example D:\\tftp), choose the \"Server interface\" 192.168.1.2 When clients are connecting to this server, you can see them in the status window.\n\n\n \n\n\nCompiling uboot\n\n\nEach device has a different uboot because it is hardware related.\n\n\nGL-AR150, GL.iNet6416, GL-AR300, GL-AR300M\n\n\nFor these models you can use \nPepe2k's\n uboot, you can download the source from github.\n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod.git\n$ cd u-boot_mod\n\n\n\n\nTo compile the source, you need to have a cross complier toolchain. I am using openwrt toolchain. Make modification to the \nMakefile\n.\n\n\nexport BUILD_TOPDIR=$(PWD)\nexport STAGING_DIR=$(BUILD_TOPDIR)/tmp\n\n# **Replace the following line with your real path**\nexport TOOLPATH=$(BUILD_TOPDIR)/../openwrt/staging_dir/toolchain-mips_34kc_gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2/\n\nexport PATH:=$(TOOLPATH)/bin:${PATH}\n\nexport MAKECMD=make --silent --no-print-directory ARCH=mips CROSS_COMPILE=mips-openwrt-linux-uclibc-\n\n# boot delay (time to autostart boot command)\nexport CONFIG_BOOTDELAY=1\n\n\n\n\nNow start to compile the source. For example, for GL.iNet 6416, you can use:\n\n\nmake gl-inet\n\n\n\n\n\nFor GL-AR150, you can do this:\n\n\nmake 8devices_carambola2\n\n\n\n\nFor GL-AR300 and GL-AR300M, we modified the code a lot so please consult us for details.\n\n\nIt should be very quick and finish in minutes. Then you will find \nuboot_for_gl-inet.bin\n in \nbin/\n.\n\n\nGL-AR150 uboot modify as IoT devices\n\n\nIf you connect IoT addon to AR150's UART, which talks to AR150 using serial. When the IoT addon send some data during uboot boot, it may stop the booting process so you never have the router alive. You need to modify the uboot a little bit so that it can succesffuly boot. \n\n\nUse this code from github \nhttps://github.com/domino-team/uboot-domino\n\n\nIn this uboot, you need to type \ngl\n quickly during uboot boot to enter uboot console.\n\n\nMT300A, MT300N, MT750\n\n\nMT series routers use a different uboot and different code. Consult us if you need.\n\n\nUsing uboot\n\n\nYou can use \nprintenv\n to display the environment variables in uboot. here are some quick guide of how to use uboot.\n\n\nFirst you need to set up tftp server as above and put your files in tftp root folder.\n\n\nbasic uboot command\n\n\nDownload file to router\n (AR150, Domino, 6416 as example)\n\n\ntftp 0x81000000 file.bin\n\n\n\n\nErase some part of flash\n\n\nerase 0x9f050000 +0x10000\n\n\n\n\nWrite file to flash\n\n\ncp.b 0x81000000 0x9f050000 0x10000\n\n\n\n\npredefined script\n\n\nActually it is not easy to use basic uboot command to do everyting. It is quite risky. Fortunately we have some pre-defined scripts that simplifeis the work.\n\n\nPlase do check using \nprintenv\n to find out the correct filename that the script trying to download. \nFor example, if you want to update uboot for AR150, the uboot file should be named as \nuboot_for_gl-ar150.bin\n and put in your tftp root folder.\n\n\nReplace uboot\n\n\nrun lu\n\n\n\n\nUpdate firmware\n\n\nrun lf\n\n\n\n\nUpdate mac address etc\n\n\nrun lc\n\n\n\n\nErase uboot env variables\n\nBe sure to use the right command for the right model\nFor AR150, Domino AR300, AR300M\n\n\nerase 0x9f040000 +0x10000\nreset\n\n\n\n\nFor 6416\n\n\nerase 0x9f010000 +0x10000\nreset\n\n\n\n\nUboot Web UI\n\n\nUboot has a webUI so that you can save your device without entering uboot console.\n\n\n\n\nCheck \nthis section\n  for how to enter uboot web UI using the reset button.\n\n\nIf you are in uboot console, you can start the WebUI the following command. This only works for AR series, not MT series.\n\n\nhttpd\n\n\n\n\nAR300M Specific\n\n\nAR300M uses dual flash so in uboot there are a lot of things to deal with dual flash. Please refer to \nAR300M\n for more details.",

Please check the following guidance for the using of file sharing among different operating systems.\n\n\nGeneral Notes\n\n\nYou may be able to access the share via \n\\\\192.168.8.1\\\n or \nsmb://192.168.8.1/\n or with \nGL-modelXXX\n instead of \n192.168.8.1\n (eg \n\\\\GL-AR750S\\\n)  in your system's file explorer. Since sharing is enabled to the LAN by default (this includes both wired AND wireless clients) and maps a \"bad user\" to Guest, then even if they don't supply a username and password or an invalid one, ANYONE connected to your router can access the files in the share in Read-Only mode. If you enable Writable mode this applies to both Guests AND the default \nroot\n user. If you enable write access, anybody can create or delete files and folders, if you disable write access, not even the \nroot\n user can delete them via SMB (they can through the CLI though). We can hope that in a future revision there is a simple user management and that a named user (or \nroot\n) can read and/or write while Guests are limited by the \nWritable\n or a \nPublic Write\n flag on a share (and having multiple shares would be great as well).\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nMethod 1: Samba 2.0 (SMB2.0) Support:\n\n\nWe suggest Samba 2.0 support for Windows 10 users.\n\n\nDue to the security vulunerabilitiy of the Samba1.0 protocol, Samba1.0 is not enabled by default in Window 10. You may modify the router Samba configuration.\n\n\n\n\n1). SSH into your router, you can gain control of both the router and the network that the rotuer is controlling. You can refer to the following link: \nhttps://docs.gl-inet.com/en/3/app/ssh/\n\n\n2). Modify the Samba configuration file, type the following command:\n\n\nsed -i 's/security = share/security = user/' /etc/samba/smb.conf.template\n\n\n3). Restart the Samba service, type the following command:\n\n\n/etc/init.d/samba restart\n\n\n\n\n4). Open 'This PC' and type \n\\\\your router IP Address\n, such as \n\\\\192.168.8.1\n.\n\n\n\n\n5). You can view files in your USB flash drive through GL.iNet router now.\n\n\nMethod 2: Samba 1.0 (SMB1.0) Support:\n\n\n1)\n Your network must be Home/Private. Otherwise you may not be able to see your router in \nNetwork\n. \n\n\n3.0 firmware supports SMB2, and if you need SMB3, use \nWinSCP to router\n, edit \n/etc/samba/smb.conf.template\n. \n\n\n\n\nChange the \"max protocol = SMB2\" to \n\n\n\"min protocol = SMB1\"\n\n\n\"max protocol = SMB3\", then \nsave\n and \nexit\n WinSCP. \n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Windows 10, you also need to enable SMB 1.0. \n\n\n\n\nWindows 7\n\n\n\n\nGo to Control panel -\n Network and Internet -\n Network and Sharing Center. Find if your active network is \nHome network\n. If not, click it and change it to \nHome network\n.\n\n\n\n\nWindows 10\n\n\n\n\nChange your network to private by this \ntutorial\n.\n\n\nGo to Control Panel -\n Programs and Features -\n Turn Windows features on or off -\n Find SMB 1.0/CIFS file sharing support, check all SMB1 related items, click apply and restart your computer.\n\n\n\n\n2)\n Open a Windows explorer, you can find \nNetwork\n in the folder directory. Double click your router to access its contents.\n\n\n\n\nMac OS\n\n\nMethod 1\n\n\n1)\n Open Finder, Menu -\n Go -\n Connect to Server... \n\n\n\n\n2)\n Input \nsmb://192.168.8.1\n, you need to change this if your router IP address is not 192.168.8.1\n\n\n\n\n3)\n Click Connect.\n\n\n\n\n4)\n Input username and password, they are the same when you login Web Admin Panel.\n\n\n\n\n5)\n Then Finder will display files of USB disk.\n\n\n\n\nMethod 2\n\n\n1)\n Go to System Preferences -\n Sharing -\n File sharing. Click \nOptions\n and then enable SMB.\n\n\n2)\n Open Finder. You should be able to find your router under Shared.\n\n\niOS\n\n\nYou have to use file manage app to access the contents of your external storage device.\n\n\nYou may use \nFE File Explorer\n:\n\n\n1)\n Click \n+\n to create a \nWindows\n connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2)\n Enter the \nIP address\n of your router (192.168.8.1). The \nUser Name\n is root and the \nPassword\n is the one that you use to login the web Admin Panel. Finally, click \nSave\n.\n\n\n\n\n3)\n Click your newly created connection to access the contents.\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nIf you are using Linux you are probably comfortable with connecting to servers, and how to do this can vary greatly from distribution to distribution and largely depends on your window manager/display environment. Most systems come with Gnome and it is the default on the very popular Ubuntu distribution, so we'll give an example using the Files tool (also called Nautilus). If you open the app you should have a \"Connect to server\" option, there you can enter either the \n\\\\servername\\share\n or \nsmb://servername/share\n format.\n\n\nChromeOS or ChromiumOS (Neverware CloudReady and others)\n\n\nThere is a built in Samba/SMB client in the Files app, but it doesn't really seem to work very well. Instead the most useful ChromeOS app to allow mounting Samba shares even though it doesn't have high ratings is \"File System for Windows\". It is open source and works far better than the built in version. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/file-system-for-windows/mfhnnfciefdpolbelmfkpmhhmlkehbdf/related?hl=en\n\n\nOnce you have installed the app you can launch it from that page, and if you want to access it again in the future, in the Files app if you go to the 3 dot menu at the top right and \"Add new service\" you then select \"File System for Windows\" from the list and it will give you the dialog to fill out with the server name and some other details, but only the server name/IP and share name are required. You can click the gear icon to enable saving the password for a share indefinitely, and you can click the \"Keep\" button to save the share to easily mount again in the future.\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\nMost Android devices have file manager which you can use to access the contents of your external storage device. Or you can use \nES file explorer\n:\n\n\n1)\n Open the app and then click \nNetwork\n.\n\n\n\n\n2)\n Click \nScan\n to find your network storage device.",

It extends the company's network, making computers resources from one location available to employees at other locations. \n\n\n\n\nSenerio 1: A company has dozens of branch offices that they wish to join in a single private network to share resources.\n\n\nSenerio 2: A company has a close relationship with a partner company, the Site to Site allows the companies to work together in a secure, shared network environment while preventing access to their separate internets.\n\n\nSenerio 3: A family has IP camera and when they are not at home, the Site to Site allows to remote access the IP camera.\n\n\nWhat conditions do I need to create Site to Site?\n\n\nOne of the loations has a public static(or dynamic) ip, and two or more GL-iNet devices with latest testing firmware.\n\n\nSteps to build a Site to Site network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade your GL.iNet devices to latest testing firmware and binded to \nGoodcloud.xyz\n. (\nhow\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the steps below to create a Site to Site network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault port is 51830, if you want to use another port, find the Advanced option at the lower left corner.\n\n\nDue to the device's performance, each Site to Site network can have up to 10 devices.\n\n\nAfter you had chosen the devices, click Continue.\n\n\n\n\nThen, it will test each device if it can be set as the Main Node of Site to Site.\n\n\nWe suggest that the router with strong performance and best network speed to be the Main Node.\n\n\n\n\nIf none of the devices can be used as the Main Node, make sure that:\n\n\n\n\nOne of routers has a public IP, either static public IP or dynamic public IP.\n\n\nPort is open, default is 51830.\n\n\nIf the router is behind NAT, you may need to set up port forwading.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also change port and try again.\n\n\n\n\nIf there are more than one device can be set as the Main Node, you need to choose one to continue.\n\n\n\n\nIf there is only one device can be set as the Main Node, it will go to the Site to Site detail page directly.\n\n\nThe network is stopped by default, check the LAN IP, if it is OK then you need to click Start button, otherwise click Setting to change LAN IP.\n\n\n\n\nWait a few minutes, the node's connect status will display as lines. Solid line means connected, dashed line means disconnected.\n\n\n\n\nTesting the Site to Site connection\n\n\nNow the Site to Site network is created and started, let's test the connection.\n\n\nUse your PC or Phone to connect to one of the Node of this Site to Site, and use browser to access another Node's LAN ip, if you see the login page, the connection between these two nodes is worked.\n\n\nFor example, my PC connect to Node 1 device, and then I use browser to access Main Node's LAN IP (192.168.48.1), if I see the login page, it means the connection between Node1 and Main Node is worked.\n\n\nRoute and other options\n\n\nYou can change each device's LAN IP and routes.\n\n\n\n\nBy default, each node can access other's LAN, based on security, we recommend only open the corresponding service IPs.\n\n\nE.g. There is a Server A(172.30.97.100) in Node 1's subnet, if you want other Site to Site nodes  only can access Node 1's Service A, you can set it like below:\n\n\n\n\nYou can add node's parent routes too.\n\n\nEach sub Node build an encrypted tunnel netwrok to Main Node, if you want to change the IP of tunnel subnet. Click 'IP Address Range'.\n\n\n\n\nBatch Setting\n\n\nYou can use this feature to configure multiple parameters for a single device, or you can configure multiple parameters for multiple devices.\n\n\nPS: This feature is only available to business users.\n\n\n\nBatch Setting of Single Device\n\n\nTo configure single device, as show below.\n\n\n\n\nThe left side of image below is correct. If your interface is like the right side of image below, please upgrade to latest testing firmware.\n\n\n\n\nCheck the configuration that needs to be modified and input value.\n\n\n\n\nThe checked configuration is required, and only the configuration that conforms to the rule can be filled out. After the configuration is delivered, it does not take effect immediately. The configuration takes effect and the device needs to be restarted. You can check the Restart now option in the lower right corner of the above figure. After the configuration is completed, the device will restart immediately.\n\n\nPreview the configuration and confirm the delivery.\n\n\n\n\nUnchecked \nRestart now\n option will prompt.\n\n\n\n\nBatch Setting of Mutiple Device\n\n\nSelect the devices you want to configure.\n\n\n\n\nOther operations are the same as when operating a single device.\n\n\nOther Batch Operations\n\n\nOther Batch Operations: Move to other group, upgrade, restart, delete.\n\n\n\n\nTemplate Management\n\n\nSave frequently used configurations as templates and quickly apply them when you modify configurations in batches.\n\n\nPS: This feature is only available to business users.\n\n\n\nAdd a Template\n\n\nCheck the configuration that needs to be modified and input value.\n\n\n\n\nGive the template a name and description.\n\n\n\n\nTask List\n\n\nAt task list page, it shows the execution result of the configuration template.\n\n\nPS: This feature is only available to business users.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view the execution result of each device and configuration.\n\n\n\n\nBLE MQTT Bridge\n\n\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is widely used for smart home, wearable and IoT sensors. This feature is for GL.iNet BLE gateway, GL-X750 Spitz and GL-S1300 convexa S which has built-in BLE modules. Read \nthis\n to learn how to use them forward your BLE data to the cloud based on MQTT protocol, including GL.iNet GoodCloud and AWS IoT.\n\n\nGoodCloud and VPN\n\n\nIf you enable GoodCloud feature on router and also use it as VPN client, there is something important you need to know.\n\n\nAt default, GoodCloud process use VPN if you enable VPN client(eg. WireGuard, OpenVPN, Shadowsocks), this bring a problem that if you VPN is configured incorrectly, GoodCloud will not work properly. In order to ensure the normal use of GoodCloud, we suggest you to follow the steps below to enable VPN Policies and disable \"Use VPN for all process on the router\". After you've done these steps, GoodCloud precess will not use VPN.\n\n\n\n\nDisable\n\n\nTo stop GoodCloud service, turn it off on router Web Admin Panel. Please follow the steps below. No action needed on the GoodCloud website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter disable Cloud, the interface is like above.",

It connects to the main board using \nUART\n. The same module support BLE and Zigbee. However you need to change the firmware on the module (not the gateway). There is no way to change the firmware from BLE to Zigbee or vice versa on the air. So you have to select the correct module when you purchase the correct product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n\n\nSpecification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Name\n\n\nBluetooth \n Zigbee Module\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\n\nGL-EFR32S/GL-EFR32H\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPU\n\n\nSilicon Labs EFR32MG1P232F256GM48-CR0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtocol\n\n\nSupport Zigbee\u3001BLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStorage\n\n\nRAM:32KB/ Flash:256KB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTx Power\n\n\n19 dBm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntenna\n\n\nOn-board antenna (external antenna IPEX reserved)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Interface\n\n\n17*GPIO (could be configured to UART\u3001SPI\u3001JTAG\u3001I2C, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule Interface Type\n\n\nStamp interface/Pin interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply Voltage\n\n\n3.3 V\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower Consumption\n\n\nsupport low power consumption, standby power\uff1c50uW\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule Dimenstion\n\n\n25mm*20mm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperation Temperature\n\n\n0\u2103~75\u2103\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStorage Temperature\n\n\n-40\u2103~85\u2103\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Humidity\n\n\n10%~90%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must use the gateway with BLE devices.\n\n\nThere are two kinds of BLE devices. One kind of BLE device use beacons to send data, e.g a BLE thermometer. Another kind of device need to pair first, e.g. BLE smart watch. \n\n\nFor BLE beacon device, you can just scan the beacon and get the data. The data is generally encrypted. It is depends on you to decrypted the data. You can decrypt locally on the gateway or just send the encrypted data to your cloud to decrypt there. \n\n\nFor BLE devices that needs to pair first, you need to know how they can pair with the gateway. Generally this is provided by the device maker. There are a lot of devices that accept standard connection so you can pair without problem.\n\n\nA list of compatible devices will be collected and posted here.\n\n\nTBD: a list of compatible BLE device.\n\n\nBLE Tools\n\n\nBoth GL-X750 and GL-S1300 come with OpenWrt and our BLE tools. \n\n\nIn your current firmware for S1300, there may be a BLE tool which comes with a UI.

You can find official document in \nmqtt.org\n.\n\n\nThis guide will give you a step to step guide of how to send message to GL.iNet GoodCloud and AWS.\n\n\nSend Data to GoodCloud\n\n\nGoodCloud is our Cloud based on MQTT under development. Now you can use it for demo purpose related to BLE. You can contact us if you have any suggestions by sending an email to admin@goodcloud.xyz. \n\n\nAll you need to do is to register an account in GoodCloud.xyz and bind your X750 or S1300 to your account.\n\n\nRegister your device on \nGoodCloud.xyz\n\n\nFollow \nthis docs\n to add devices on GoodCloud. \n\n\nWhere is the config file\n\n\nThe config file for cloud is in UCI. You will need to modify this directly if you want to connect to your own MQTT cloud.\n\n\nroot@GL-S1300:~# cat /etc/config/glconfig\n....\nconfig service 'cloud'\n        option enable '1'\n        option check_status '1'\n        option serverzone 'gslb-jp.goodcloud.xyz'\n        option username 'your name'\n        option email 'your@email.address'\n        option bindtime '1558928701947'\n\n\n\n\n\nForward data to GoodCloud\n\n\nTo forward data to GoodCloud, you can use simple shell script. \n\n\nAfter your device is connected to your cloud account, you can \nSSH\n to the router, try the following command.  \n\n\nroot@GL-S1300:~# ubus call mqtt pub '{\napi\n:\n/user/data\n, \ndata\n:\nhello from S1300\n\n}'\n{\n        \ncode\n: 0\n}\nroot@GL-S1300:~#\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin the \nGoodCloud\n\uff0cfind the registered device in \"device list\", click the device name and you will find your message in timeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend Data to AWS IoT\n\n\nAmazon AWS IoT is a good choice for business applications. AWS seems to have good security and privacy protection. Here we will give an example of how to send your data to AWS IoT platform. It is a little complicated but still OK for IT specialist. \n\n\n1. Setting up your AWS IoT environment\n\n\n1) On the \nWelcome to the AWS IoT Console\n page, in the navigation pane, choose \nManage-\nThings\n , then \nRegister a thing\n. \n\n\n\n\n2) On the \nCreating AWS IoT things\n page, choose \nCreate a single thing\n.\n\n\n\n\n3) On the \nCreate a thing\n page, in the \nName\n field, type a name for your thing, such as \nx750\n. Choose \nNext\n.\n\n\n\n\n4) On the \nAdd a certificate for your thing\n page, choose \nCreate certificate\n. This generates an X.509 certificate and key pair.\n\n\n\n\n5) On the \nCertificate created!\n page, download your public and private keys, certificate, and root certificate authority (CA):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose \nDownload\n for your certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose \nDownload\n for your private key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose \nDownload\n for the Amazon root CA. This will display a new web page. Choose \nRSA 2048 bit key: Amazon Root CA 1\n. This opens another web page with the text of the root CA certificate. Copy this text and paste it into a file named \nAmazon_Root_CA_1.pem\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost web browsers save downloaded files into a Downloads directory. You will copy these files to a different directory when you run the sample applications. Choose \nActivate\n to activate the X.509 certificate, and then choose \nAttach a policy\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nRSA 2048 bit key: Amazon Root CA1\n download web page:\n\n\n\n\n6) Active your thing\n\n\nBack to the previous site, click \"\nActivate\n\", then click \"\nDone\n\". \n\n\n\n\n2.

You can decrypt locally on the gateway or just send the encrypted data to your cloud to decrypt there.   For BLE devices that needs to pair first, you need to know how they can pair with the gateway.

You can use the data for your laptop.\n\n\nUsing your phone as a hotspot directly is easy, but you cannot connect too many devices.\n\n\n\n\nIt is very easy to share your data to GL.iNet mini router using router's control interfaces, but in some phone and carrier network, they limit sharing data directly, so you can try EasyTether.\n\n\nWe will use Android OS and GL mini router to demonstrate the procedure.\n\n\n\n\nStuff you need\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\n1)     Samsung Galaxy S6 with Android OS\n\n\n2)     GL-AR150 mini router (Other models are also OK)\n\n\n3)     4G sim card\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\n1)     WinSCP (\nhttps://winscp.net/eng/download.php\n)\n\n\n\n\n2)     PuTTY (\nhttps://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html\n)\n\n\n\n\n3)     EasyTether driver openssl (\nhttp://www.mobile-stream.com/easytether/drivers.html\n)\n\n\n\n\n     *Note: For MT300N-V2, please choose LEDE.*\n\n\n\n\n\n4)     EasyTether Android App (Search in Google Play Store)\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\nPreparing your router\n\n\n1) Set up the router\n\n\nEnter 192.168.8.1 in your browser and get into the router web interface. Set the password which will be used for OpenWRT later. Next, update your router to the latest firmware.\n\n\n2) Transfer IPK driver package to the router\n\n\ni.\n Find out the chip of your model (for example Atheros 9531, MediaTek MT7620N, etc) from the website. It is because you have to choose the IPK driver package in the EasyTether driver file base on the chip of your router. (For GL router, you can find the information on our website: www.gl-inet.com, and we will also indicate the position of the IPK driver file for our mini router in section iv.):\n\n\n\n\nii.\n Extract the EasyTether driver file. Open WinSCP, choose SCP as the file protocol and enter the information as the figure shown below:\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the following screen once your connection has been established (left-hand side: Your PC, right-hand side: Your router):\n\n\n\n\niii.\n Go to the main folder by clicking this button.\n\n\n\n\nYou will see the directory tree of the router:\n\n\n\n\niv.\n On the left-hand side (Your PC), find the IPK file of your router in EasyTether driver file you have extracted before. On the right-hand side (Your router), open the tmp folder. Lastly, right click the IPK file and choose upload:\n\n\nNote: For Atheros chip, choose 15.05.1\\ar71xx\\generic. For MediaTeck, choose 15.05.1\\ramips\\mt7620. For other chips, please find the similar file name.\n\n\nMT300N \n MT300A: \\15.05.1\\ramips\\mt7620\\ easytether-usb-openssl_0.8.7-1_ramips_24kec.ipk\n\n\nAR150 \n AR300M: \\15.05.1\\ar71xx\\generic\\easytether-usb-openssl_0.8.7-1_ar71xx.ipk\n\n\n\n\n3) Use SSH to install EasyTether driver\n\n\ni.\n Open PuTTY, enter the IP of your router and other information as the figure shown below, then click Open:\n\n\n\n\nii.\n Login by using your username and password of the router (username: root; password: same as the one you need for entering the web interface):\n\n\nNote: The password you entered will not be showed on the screen.\n\n\n\n\niii.\n You can now update the OpenWRT modules (internet connection required) by typing:\n\n\nopkg update\n\n\nHit enter and then it will update automatically.\n\n\nNote: You can skip the update and do it after you have finished tethering.\n\n\niv.\n Install the driver by typing the following command and then hit enter:\n\n\nopkg install /tmp/filename.ipk\n\n\nNote: The filename is the file you uploaded in Procedure A)2.ii.\n\n\nv.\n Type in the following command and hit enter:\n\n\neasytether-usb\n\n\nvi.\n Copy the following command to Putty:\n\n\ncat \n EOF \n /etc/config/network\n\nconfig interface 'wan'\noption ifname 'tap-easytether'\noption proto 'dhcp'\nEOF\n\n\n\n\nNote:  To paste it into Putty, just right click the black screen and then hit enter.\n\n\nvii.\n Type in the following command to reboot your router or unplug the power cable of your router. Afterward, plug in the power cable to turn on the router.\n\n\nreboot -f\n\n\nPreparing your smart phone\n\n\n1) Enable the Developer Options\n\n\ni.\n Go to Setting -\n About Device -\n Software info. Hitting the build number several times and it will announce that you have turn on the Developer Options.\n\n\n\n\nii.\n Go to Setting -\n Developer Options, turn on the Developer Options and also the USB debugging.\n\n\n\n\n2) Start tethering\n\n\ni.\n Open EasyTether App, tick the USB button, it will show \u201cwaiting for connection from the host\u201d. \n\n\n\n\nii.\n Connect your phone to the router via USB cable. Hit OK to allow the USB debugging.\n\n\n\n\niii.\n Your connection has been established.\n\n\n\n\nYou can now connect your device to the router and access the Internet. However, if you are using the lite version of EasyTether app, you will not able to access the website with https like: https://www.youtube.com since this type of secure communication is being blocked by the lite version.\n\n\nAdvanced Configuration\n\n\nIf you are using your WAN ethernet port to connect to the internet, it may be tedious to ssh into your router when you want to switch between EasyTether and ethernet. This section will show you how to set your router up so you can use either one without needing to ssh into the router and reconfigure the interfaces.\n\n\ni.\n Create the EasyTether interface\n\n\nSSH into your router with Putty and run the the following command:\n\n\ncat \n EOF \n /etc/config/network\n\nconfig interface 'easytether'\n        option proto 'dhcp'\n        option metric '30'\n        option ifname 'tap-easytether'\nEOF\n\n\n\n\nii.\n Add the EasyTether interface to the firewall.\n\n\nSSH into your router with Putty and run the the following command:\n\n\nvi /etc/config/firewall\n\n\n\n\nPress \ni\n to change edit mode to insert.\n\nYou wil see several entries starting with \nconfig zone\n. Find the one with \noption name 'wan'\n.\n\nAdd \neasytether\n to the end of \noption network\n. (See example below)\n\nPress \nEsc\n, then type \n:wq\n.  \n\n\nExample:\n\n\nconfig zone\n        option name 'wan'\n        option input 'REJECT'\n        option output 'ACCEPT'\n        option forward 'REJECT'\n        option masq '1'\n        option mtu_fix '1'\n        option network 'wan wan6 wwan easytether'\n\n\n\n\nEnabling auto-connect\n\n\nThis will enable the router to automatically estabilish an easytether connection.\n\n\ni.\n SSH into your router with Putty and run the the following commands:\n\n\ncat \n EOF \n /etc/config/easytether\n\nwhile true\ndo\n        if (ip a s tap-easytether up); then\n        else\n                easytether-usb\n        fi\nsleep 1\ndone\nEOF\n\n\n\n\ncat \n EOF \n /etc/crontabs/root\n\n@reboot sh /etc/config/easytether\nEOF\n\n\n\n\nInterface priority\n\n\nIt can be useful to use EasyTether as a fallback connection in the event your main source of internet goes down. This section shows you how to set interface priorities.\n\n\ni.\n SSH into your router with Putty and run the the following commands:\n\n\nvi /etc/config/network\n\n\n\n\nEdit the \noption metric\n value to your desired results for each interface. The lower the number, the higher the priority.  \n\n\nThe recommended settings are as follows:\n\n\noption metric 10\n \nwan\n (Ethernet)\n\n\noption metric 20\n \nwwan\n (Wi-Fi Repeater)\n\n\noption metric 30\n \neasytether\n (EasyTether)",

You should use an active or passive 48V 802.3af PoE injector. Also, \ndon't\n use USB power and PoE at the same time. Otherwise, the router will burn immediately.\n\n\n\nApplications\n\n\n\n\nWhich VPN protocol and VPN service provider does the router support?\n\n\nOur routers support OpenVPN and WireGuard.\n\n\nPlease check \nhere\n for the list of compatible OpenVPN service providers.\n\n\nPlease check \nhere\n for the list of WireGuard service providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to install OpenWrt package to the router?\n\n\nYou can install OpenWrt package to the router through Admin Panel.\n\n\n\n\nAccess the web Admin Panel via 192.168.8.1\n\n\nGo to \nAPPLICATIONS\n -\n \nPlug-ins\n.\n\n\nClick \nUpdate\n to update the package repository and install the package that you need.\n\n\nOr You can SSH to the router. We suggest \nPutty\n for Windows users. Mac/Linux users can use \nTerminal\n.\nOnce you have SSH to the router, you can install OpenWrt package by these commands:\n\nopkg update\nopkg install PackageName\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy my OpenVPN connection returned Auth_failed?\n\n\nYour username/password for OpenVPN login over a router with your VPN provider is not the same username password combination (email/password) you use when you login the VPN provider's website. You should be able to find the configuration on the account dashboard.",

Note: The name of the interface can be changed in the Advanced Settings of Interface Configuration, you can leave it blank. If you want to give it a name such as wlan0, please use different names for different wireless interfaces.     My device can only be connected through Ethernet cable.  Can I use this router to connect my device to a wireless network?  Yes, please connect your device to the LAN port of the router and then set up  repeater .  Note: For Microuter, if your device has USB port, connect Microuter to it and check if Microuter can create a USB to Ethernet connection. Then set up repeater. For GL-AR300M-Lite, since it has only one WAN port, you can only do that after you have connected to it wirelessly and changed its WAN port to LAN port.    Can I connect to an existing Wi-Fi network (i.e. public Wi-Fi or hotel Wi-Fi) and then create my own Wi-Fi network?   Yes, our routers will boardcast their own Wi-Fi network by default. Once you have connected to the router, you can connect it to an existing Wi-Fi network.    Why there is no captive portal page for me to enter my authentication information when I connect to a public hotspot?  Please follow the instructions below to disable the DNS rebind protection.   \n     Connect to the public hotspot which requires authentication through captive portal. \n     \n       \n     Go to Admin Panel -  MORE SETTINGS -  Custom DNS Server. Then, disable  DNS Rebinding Attack Protection . \n       \n     Use your web browser to visit a webpage, it will be redirected to the captive portal of the hotspot automatically. \n     If you are using smartphone but your web browser doesn't redirect to the captive portal. Please turn off the Wi-Fi of your smartphone and then turn it on and reconnect to the Wi-Fi of your router again. The captive portal should be popped up directly after you entered the Wi-Fi password.\n     \n          Which 2.4GHz/5GHz WiFi channels can I choose on this router?  For 2.4GHz, you can choose channel 1 to 11.  For 5GHz, you can choose channel 36 to 48, 149 to 165. Our routers don't support DFS Channel 52 to 140.    Can I connect to a EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) Wi-Fi network which requires username and password authentication?  Yes, the Admin Panel will ask you for your authentication information when you connect to a EAP Wi-Fi network. However, GL-MT300N-V2 doesn\u2019t support EAP.",

            "text": "Can I power on the router using the USB port of my computer or power bank?  The USB port on a computer or a GOOD power bank should be able to provide enough power for the router. However, it may cause malfunction if the power input is unstable or insufficient.    Can I install my own external antenna?  Only the external antenna version or the product model marked with suffix \" Ext \" (e.g. GL-AR300M-Ext) has antenna jack. You can connect a  RP-SMA  Wi-Fi antenna to it.  However, For internal antenna version, you  cannot  connect any external antenna to it.    Can it work with 3G/4G USB modem?  Yes, only Microuter (GL-USB150) doesn't support USB modem. Please find the list of compatible USB modem  here .    Does this router work with SIM card directly?  Only our  4G Smart Router (GL-MiFi)  with built-in LTE module supports this feature. You can insert a  Micro SIM  into the SIM card slot of the router and then set up 3G/4G modem in the web Admin Panel.  Please find the detailed setup instruction  here .    Can I share the network data from my phone to the router?  Yes, you can connect your smartphone to the USB port of the router and then set up  Tethering . It works with Andriod and iPhone, but doesn\u2019t work with Windows phone.    Does it charge my phone's battery during Tethering?  Yes, when you connect your phone to the USB port of the router, the router will charge your phone. However, the charging rate may be slower than the power consumption rate of your phone.    Can I connect my USB printer to the router?  It doesn\u2019t work with USB printer by default. You need to install necessary driver and printer server (cups).    Can I use this router with USB storage device (e.g. USB stick, USB hard drive)?  Yes, please make sure your storage device is formatted in FAT32, NTFS, Ext3, Ext4. exFAT is not supported.  We have tested 64GB USB stick and 1TB USB hard drive but we haven't tested the storage device with higher storage capacity so far.   Can I connect another Wi-Fi dongle to the USB port of the router so as to create another radio?  Yes, our routers support Wi-Fi dongles with 3070 or 8187 chipset.    Can I power on the router over Ethernet cable (PoE)?  Only GL-AR150 and GL-AR750 have PoE option.  The PoE only works on the  WAN port . You should use an active or passive 48V 802.3af PoE injector. Also,  don't  use USB power and PoE at the same time. Otherwise, the router will burn immediately.",
