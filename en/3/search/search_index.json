When installing packages to the router, it takes no more than 20% for the time spent than using nor flash, including the time to download resource from the Internet. So everything just happends in seconds.\n\n\nBuilding Firmware\n\n\nThe router has two flash so we have two firmwares. One firmware is installed on the Nor flash and one is installed on the nand flash. The two firmware is independent from each other. The router will always try to boot from the nand flash. If it fails for 3 times it will boot from the Nor flash.\n\n\nBy using two firmwares, businesses can have dual boot options to ensure the system can backup, upgrade and boot without problems.\n\n\nBuilding the generic firmware for nor flash\n\n\nThe simple instructions of building the firmware can be found here: https://github.com/gl-inet/lede-17.01\nYou need to have a Linux machine. In this example we use Ubuntu.\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install subversion build-essential git-core libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk flex quilt libssl-dev xsltproc libxml-parser-perl mercurial bzr ecj cvs unzip git wget\n$ git clone https://github.com/domino-team/openwrt-cc.git\n$ cd openwrt-cc\n$ ./scripts/feeds update -a\n$ ./scripts/feeds install -a\n$ make menuconfig\n  ..choose your compile target and packages\n$ make\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to build the firmware for nor flash, choose \nGL-AR300M\n as the target.\n\n\n\n\nBuild the nand firmware for nand flash\n\n\nIf you want to build the firmware for nand flash, first choose subtarget \nGeneric devices with NAND flash\n then choose \nGL-AR300M Nand\n as the target.\n\n\n\n\nThe make process will takes around 1 hour for the first time because it needs to download a lot of data from t he Internet. After compiling finished, you will find the following firmware files in \nbin/ar71xx/\n\n\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-generic-gl-ar300m-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin\n, for nor flash\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-nand-gl-ar300m-squashfs-sysupgrade.tar\n, for nand flash firmware upgrade inside of a working Openwrt firmware\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-nand-gl-ar300m-ubi.img\n, for initial nand flash firmware build, this is used when upgrading using uboot.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThere is two file for nand firmware. The \nxxx-ubi.img\n is used for first time writing to the nand flash. If you are using uboot to upgrade the firmware, please use this one. The \nxxx-sysupgrade.tar\n is used for upgrading from openwrt. So if you use our stock firmware or already using an openwrt firmware, choose this one.\n\n\nUsing Firmware\n\n\nThe firmware has exactly the same UI as our other mini routers. To determine you are using nor flash or nand flash, please check the available space from the UI.\n\n\nControl which firmware you are booting into\n\n\nThere are two methods to control which firmware you can boot.\n\n\nMethod 1: set boot count\n\n\nThe router will always try to boot into the nand firmware. But if it fails for 3 times it will try to boot into the nor firmware. If you want to boot into the nor firmware, you can tell the router that it failed to boot for 3 times already by setting the uboot env. To do so, you can use the following command in a SSH terminal.\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv bootcount 3\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nYou need to do this each time\n if you want to boot into nor firmware, no matter you which firmware you are using. Otherwise after the firmware boot, it will reset \nbootcount\n variable and next boot will always try to boot the nand firmware.\n\n\nMethod 2: using the switch\n\n\nThis is only valid in the new uboot (from Mar 2017).\n\n\nFirst ssh to the router and set uboot env \nboot_dev\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv boot_dev on\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nThen when the router boot, the router will choose which firmware to boot using the hardware switch.\n1. Left side (near the reset button) --\n Nand flash\n2. Right side  --\n Nor flash\n\n\nTo disable using the switch to choose firmware function, clear \nboot_dev\n variable.\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv boot_dev\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nDebrick\n\n\nIf you brick your router and it cannot boot, you can try to save it using uboot.\n\n\nUsing uboot web UI\n\n\nFollow \nthis guide\n for a general instruction to get access of uboot web UI.\n\n\nHere is a video guide for entering AR300M uboot failsafe. \n\n\n\nIn some early version of AR300M, the uboot boot very slowly. So be patient when you press and hold the reset button. The LEDs will start to flash around 5 seconds.\n\n\nThere is a bug in AR300M uboot and in some computers the connection will always reset when you upload firmware. Check \nthis post\n to find the discussion. You can either try chaning the MTU or just try another computer.\n\n\nNote\n: If you have an older version of uboot, the webUI will only be able to flash NAND flash. This is fixed in newer versions.\n\n\nNote\n: When flash NAND firmware, only use the firmware with \n.img\n in the name, not the one with \n.rar\n in the name.\n\n\nThe following figure is the web ui of the \nnew\n uboot.\n\n\n\n\nUsing uboot console\n\n\nIf you want to use uboot console, you need to open the case and solder the serial connectors.\n\n\nThen you need to set up a tftp server.\n\n\nin uboot console, the command to flash nor flash is \nrun lf\n to flash nand firmware is \nrun nlf",

That is useful when you are using the router as a \nrepeater\n. As a result, you can have one more LAN port.\n\n\n\n\nPlug the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router. The information of your connection will be shown on the Cable section. DHCP is the default protocol. You can click \nModify\n to change the protocol.\n\n\n\n\nDHCP\n\n\nDHCP is the default and most common protocol. It doesn't require any manual configuration.\n\n\n\n\nStatic\n\n\nStatic is required if your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided a fixed IP address for you or you want to configure the network information such as IP address, Gateway, Netmask manually.\n\n\nThe current settings will be automatically filled once you choose Static. Change it according to your needs and then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\nPPPoE\n\n\nPPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username \n password that you needed when you are creating the Internet connection.\n\n\nUnder PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Repeater\n\n\nUsing Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe.\n\n\nIt works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network.\n\n\nIn Repeater section, click \nScan\n to search for the available wireless networks nearby.\n\n\n\n\nChoose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password.

Using MQTT, it can forward BLE messages to the cloud and on the other hand forward messages from cloud to the connected BLE device through BLE notify.  \n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\nGL-S10 provide a BLE instructions set. Send commands and messages by writting GATT characteriscs , and get responses or messages from BLE notification.\n\nFollowing is the steps to use this gateway.\n\n\n1. Scan and connect\n\n\nThe gateway act as a GATT server and broadcast itself once power-on. Its name is \"GL-S10\".\nFirstly start the BLE scan and search the name \"GL-S10\" using your BLE device, then connect to it.\n\n\n2. Enable the notify\n\n\nThe gateway BLE has two GATT services. \n\nOne is for receiving commands and messages. Its service UUID is \n000000FF-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB\n, has only one characteristic, UUID is \n0000FF01-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB\n. Its characteristic property is \nwrite\n.\n\nAnother is for notification. Its service UUID is \n000000EE-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB\n, has only one characteristic, UUID is \n0000EE01-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB\n. This characteristic property is \nread|notify\n.\n\nTo get the notification, you have to enable the notify function of the second service.\n\n\n3.

Modify its content and change the TFTP_DIRECTORY to your folder which will contains your files.\n\n\nTFTP_USERNAME=\nTFTP\n\nTFTP_DIRECTORY=\n/tftpboot\n\nTFTP_ADDRESS=\n[::]:69\n\nTFTP_OPTIONS=\n--secure\n\n\n\n\n\nSometime the service cannot be started because network is not available when it starts. Start the service manually.\n\n\nsudo service tftpd-hpa restart\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nDownload service edition of tftpd from http://tftpd32.jounin.net/tftpd32_download.html, then install it.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn off windows firewall, which is the main reason causing tftpd failed to connect.\n\n\n \n\n\nRun tftpd64_SE Admin, choose your tftpd root (in this example D:\\tftp), choose the \"Server interface\" 192.168.1.2 When clients are connecting to this server, you can see them in the status window.\n\n\n \n\n\nCompiling uboot\n\n\nEach device has a different uboot because it is hardware related.\n\n\nGL-AR150, GL.iNet6416, GL-AR300, GL-AR300M\n\n\nFor these models you can use \nPepe2k's\n uboot, you can download the source from github.\n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod.git\n$ cd u-boot_mod\n\n\n\n\nTo compile the source, you need to have a cross complier toolchain. I am using openwrt toolchain. Make modification to the \nMakefile\n.\n\n\nexport BUILD_TOPDIR=$(PWD)\nexport STAGING_DIR=$(BUILD_TOPDIR)/tmp\n\n# **Replace the following line with your real path**\nexport TOOLPATH=$(BUILD_TOPDIR)/../openwrt/staging_dir/toolchain-mips_34kc_gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2/\n\nexport PATH:=$(TOOLPATH)/bin:${PATH}\n\nexport MAKECMD=make --silent --no-print-directory ARCH=mips CROSS_COMPILE=mips-openwrt-linux-uclibc-\n\n# boot delay (time to autostart boot command)\nexport CONFIG_BOOTDELAY=1\n\n\n\n\nNow start to compile the source. For example, for GL.iNet 6416, you can use:\n\n\nmake gl-inet\n\n\n\n\n\nFor GL-AR150, you can do this:\n\n\nmake 8devices_carambola2\n\n\n\n\nFor GL-AR300 and GL-AR300M, we modified the code a lot so please consult us for details.\n\n\nIt should be very quick and finish in minutes. Then you will find \nuboot_for_gl-inet.bin\n in \nbin/\n.\n\n\nGL-AR150 uboot modify as IoT devices\n\n\nIf you connect IoT addon to AR150's UART, which talks to AR150 using serial. When the IoT addon send some data during uboot boot, it may stop the booting process so you never have the router alive. You need to modify the uboot a little bit so that it can succesffuly boot. \n\n\nUse this code from github \nhttps://github.com/domino-team/uboot-domino\n\n\nIn this uboot, you need to type \ngl\n quickly during uboot boot to enter uboot console.\n\n\nMT300A, MT300N, MT750\n\n\nMT series routers use a different uboot and different code. Consult us if you need.\n\n\nUsing uboot\n\n\nYou can use \nprintenv\n to display the environment variables in uboot. here are some quick guide of how to use uboot.\n\n\nFirst you need to set up tftp server as above and put your files in tftp root folder.\n\n\nbasic uboot command\n\n\nDownload file to router\n (AR150, Domino, 6416 as example)\n\n\ntftp 0x81000000 file.bin\n\n\n\n\nErase some part of flash\n\n\nerase 0x9f050000 +0x10000\n\n\n\n\nWrite file to flash\n\n\ncp.b 0x81000000 0x9f050000 0x10000\n\n\n\n\npredefined script\n\n\nActually it is not easy to use basic uboot command to do everyting. It is quite risky. Fortunately we have some pre-defined scripts that simplifeis the work.\n\n\nPlase do check using \nprintenv\n to find out the correct filename that the script trying to download. \nFor example, if you want to update uboot for AR150, the uboot file should be named as \nuboot_for_gl-ar150.bin\n and put in your tftp root folder.\n\n\nReplace uboot\n\n\nrun lu\n\n\n\n\nUpdate firmware\n\n\nrun lf\n\n\n\n\nUpdate mac address etc\n\n\nrun lc\n\n\n\n\nErase uboot env variables\n\nBe sure to use the right command for the right model\nFor AR150, Domino AR300, AR300M\n\n\nerase 0x9f040000 +0x10000\nreset\n\n\n\n\nFor 6416\n\n\nerase 0x9f010000 +0x10000\nreset\n\n\n\n\nUboot Web UI\n\n\nUboot has a webUI so that you can save your device without entering uboot console.\n\n\n\n\nCheck \nthis section\n  for how to enter uboot web UI using the reset button.\n\n\nIf you are in uboot console, you can start the WebUI the following command. This only works for AR series, not MT series.\n\n\nhttpd\n\n\n\n\nAR300M Specific\n\n\nAR300M uses dual flash so in uboot there are a lot of things to deal with dual flash. Please refer to \nAR300M\n for more details.",

Please check the following guidance for the using of file sharing among different operating systems.\n\n\nGeneral Notes\n\n\nYou may be able to access the share via \n\\\\192.168.8.1\\\n or \nsmb://192.168.8.1/\n or with \nGL-modelXXX\n instead of \n192.168.8.1\n (eg \n\\\\GL-AR750S\\\n)  in your system's file explorer. Since sharing is enabled to the LAN by default (this includes both wired AND wireless clients) and maps a \"bad user\" to Guest, then even if they don't supply a username and password or an invalid one, ANYONE connected to your router can access the files in the share in Read-Only mode. If you enable Writable mode this applies to both Guests AND the default \nroot\n user. If you enable write access, anybody can create or delete files and folders, if you disable write access, not even the \nroot\n user can delete them via SMB (they can through the CLI though). We can hope that in a future revision there is a simple user management and that a named user (or \nroot\n) can read and/or write while Guests are limited by the \nWritable\n or a \nPublic Write\n flag on a share (and having multiple shares would be great as well).\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nMethod 1: Samba 2.0 (SMB2.0) Support:\n\n\nWe suggest Samba 2.0 support for Windows 10 users.\n\n\nDue to the security vulunerabilitiy of the Samba1.0 protocol, Samba1.0 is not enabled by default in Window 10. You may modify the router Samba configuration.\n\n\n\n\n1). SSH into your router, you can gain control of both the router and the network that the rotuer is controlling. You can refer to the following link: \nhttps://docs.gl-inet.com/en/3/app/ssh/\n\n\n2). Modify the Samba configuration file, type the following command:\n\n\nsed -i 's/security = share/security = user/' /etc/samba/smb.conf.template\n\n\n3). Restart the Samba service, type the following command:\n\n\n/etc/init.d/samba restart\n\n\n\n\n4). Open 'This PC' and type \n\\\\your router IP Address\n, such as \n\\\\192.168.8.1\n.\n\n\n\n\n5). You can view files in your USB flash drive through GL.iNet router now.\n\n\nMethod 2: Samba 1.0 (SMB1.0) Support:\n\n\n1)\n Your network must be Home/Private. Otherwise you may not be able to see your router in \nNetwork\n. \n\n\n3.0 firmware supports SMB2, and if you need SMB3, use \nWinSCP to router\n, edit \n/etc/samba/smb.conf.template\n. \n\n\n\n\nChange the \"max protocol = SMB2\" to \n\n\n\"min protocol = SMB1\"\n\n\n\"max protocol = SMB3\", then \nsave\n and \nexit\n WinSCP. \n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Windows 10, you also need to enable SMB 1.0. \n\n\n\n\nWindows 7\n\n\n\n\nGo to Control panel -\n Network and Internet -\n Network and Sharing Center. Find if your active network is \nHome network\n. If not, click it and change it to \nHome network\n.\n\n\n\n\nWindows 10\n\n\n\n\nChange your network to private by this \ntutorial\n.\n\n\nGo to Control Panel -\n Programs and Features -\n Turn Windows features on or off -\n Find SMB 1.0/CIFS file sharing support, check all SMB1 related items, click apply and restart your computer.\n\n\n\n\n2)\n Open a Windows explorer, you can find \nNetwork\n in the folder directory. Double click your router to access its contents.\n\n\n\n\nMac OS\n\n\nMethod 1\n\n\n1)\n Open Finder, Menu -\n Go -\n Connect to Server... \n\n\n\n\n2)\n Input \nsmb://192.168.8.1\n, you need to change this if your router IP address is not 192.168.8.1\n\n\n\n\n3)\n Click Connect.\n\n\n\n\n4)\n Input username and password, they are the same when you login Web Admin Panel.\n\n\n\n\n5)\n Then Finder will display files of USB disk.\n\n\n\n\nMethod 2\n\n\n1)\n Go to System Preferences -\n Sharing -\n File sharing. Click \nOptions\n and then enable SMB.\n\n\n2)\n Open Finder. You should be able to find your router under Shared.\n\n\niOS\n\n\nYou have to use file manage app to access the contents of your external storage device.\n\n\nYou may use \nFE File Explorer\n:\n\n\n1)\n Click \n+\n to create a \nWindows\n connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2)\n Enter the \nIP address\n of your router (192.168.8.1). The \nUser Name\n is root and the \nPassword\n is the one that you use to login the web Admin Panel. Finally, click \nSave\n.\n\n\n\n\n3)\n Click your newly created connection to access the contents.\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nIf you are using Linux you are probably comfortable with connecting to servers, and how to do this can vary greatly from distribution to distribution and largely depends on your window manager/display environment. Most systems come with Gnome and it is the default on the very popular Ubuntu distribution, so we'll give an example using the Files tool (also called Nautilus). If you open the app you should have a \"Connect to server\" option, there you can enter either the \n\\\\servername\\share\n or \nsmb://servername/share\n format.\n\n\nChromeOS or ChromiumOS (Neverware CloudReady and others)\n\n\nThere is a built in Samba/SMB client in the Files app, but it doesn't really seem to work very well. Instead the most useful ChromeOS app to allow mounting Samba shares even though it doesn't have high ratings is \"File System for Windows\". It is open source and works far better than the built in version. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/file-system-for-windows/mfhnnfciefdpolbelmfkpmhhmlkehbdf/related?hl=en\n\n\nOnce you have installed the app you can launch it from that page, and if you want to access it again in the future, in the Files app if you go to the 3 dot menu at the top right and \"Add new service\" you then select \"File System for Windows\" from the list and it will give you the dialog to fill out with the server name and some other details, but only the server name/IP and share name are required. You can click the gear icon to enable saving the password for a share indefinitely, and you can click the \"Keep\" button to save the share to easily mount again in the future.\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\nMost Android devices have file manager tool which maybe can be used to access the files on Network Devices using SMB. Or you can search file explorer app which support SMB on Google Play.\n\n\nHere I'm going to use \nSolid Explorer File Manager\n as an example:\n\n\n1)\n Open the app.\n\n\n\n\n2)\n Click the \nPlus sign button\n on the right bottom of page, then choose \nNew cloud connection\n.\n\n\n\n\n3)\n Choose \nLAN / SMB\n.\n\n\n\n\n4)\n Choose the Server, the IP address of your device.\n\n\n\n\n5)\n Choose \nGuest\n.\n\n\n\n\n6)\n Choose \nYes\n.\n\n\n\n\n7)\n Choose \nSMB 1\n.\n\n\n\n\n8)\n Click \nNEXT\n.",

It extends the company's network, making computers resources from one location available to employees at other locations. \n\n\n\n\nSenerio 1: A company has dozens of branch offices that they wish to join in a single private network to share resources.\n\n\nSenerio 2: A company has a close relationship with a partner company, the Site to Site allows the companies to work together in a secure, shared network environment while preventing access to their separate internets.\n\n\nSenerio 3: A family has IP camera and when they are not at home, the Site to Site allows to remote access the IP camera.\n\n\nWhat conditions do I need to create Site to Site?\n\n\nOne of the loations has a public static(or dynamic) ip, and two or more GL-iNet devices with latest testing firmware.\n\n\nSteps to build a Site to Site network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade your GL.iNet devices to latest testing firmware and binded to \nGoodcloud.xyz\n. (\nhow\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the steps below to create a Site to Site network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault port is 51830, if you want to use another port, find the Advanced option at the lower left corner.\n\n\nDue to the device's performance, each Site to Site network can have up to 10 devices.\n\n\nAfter you had chosen the devices, click Continue.\n\n\n\n\nThen, it will test each device if it can be set as the Main Node of Site to Site.\n\n\nWe suggest that the router with strong performance and best network speed to be the Main Node.\n\n\n\n\nIf none of the devices can be used as the Main Node, make sure that:\n\n\n\n\nOne of routers has a public IP, either static public IP or dynamic public IP.\n\n\nPort is open, default is 51830.\n\n\nIf the router is behind NAT, you may need to set up port forwading.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also change port and try again.\n\n\n\n\nIf there are more than one device can be set as the Main Node, you need to choose one to continue.\n\n\n\n\nIf there is only one device can be set as the Main Node, it will go to the Site to Site detail page directly.\n\n\nThe network is stopped by default, check the LAN IP, if it is OK then you need to click Start button, otherwise click Setting to change LAN IP.\n\n\n\n\nWait a few minutes, the node's connect status will display as lines. Solid line means connected, dashed line means disconnected.\n\n\n\n\nTesting the Site to Site connection\n\n\nNow the Site to Site network is created and started, let's test the connection.\n\n\nUse your PC or Phone to connect to one of the Node of this Site to Site, and use browser to access another Node's LAN ip, if you see the login page, the connection between these two nodes is worked.\n\n\nFor example, my PC connect to Node 1 device, and then I use browser to access Main Node's LAN IP (192.168.48.1), if I see the login page, it means the connection between Node1 and Main Node is worked.\n\n\nRoute and other options\n\n\nYou can change each device's LAN IP and routes.\n\n\n\n\nBy default, each node can access other's LAN, based on security, we recommend only open the corresponding service IPs.\n\n\nE.g. There is a Server A(172.30.97.100) in Node 1's subnet, if you want other Site to Site nodes  only can access Node 1's Service A, you can set it like below:\n\n\n\n\nYou can add node's parent routes too.\n\n\nEach sub Node build an encrypted tunnel netwrok to Main Node, if you want to change the IP of tunnel subnet. Click 'IP Address Range'.\n\n\n\n\nBatch Setting\n\n\nYou can use this feature to configure multiple parameters for a single device, or you can configure multiple parameters for multiple devices.\n\n\nPS: This feature is only available to business users.\n\n\n\nBatch Setting of Single Device\n\n\nTo configure single device, as show below.\n\n\n\n\nThe left side of image below is correct. If your interface is like the right side of image below, please upgrade to latest testing firmware.\n\n\n\n\nCheck the configuration that needs to be modified and input value.\n\n\n\n\nThe checked configuration is required, and only the configuration that conforms to the rule can be filled out. After the configuration is delivered, it does not take effect immediately. The configuration takes effect and the device needs to be restarted. You can check the Restart now option in the lower right corner of the above figure. After the configuration is completed, the device will restart immediately.\n\n\nPreview the configuration and confirm the delivery.\n\n\n\n\nUnchecked \nRestart now\n option will prompt.\n\n\n\n\nBatch Setting of Mutiple Device\n\n\nSelect the devices you want to configure.\n\n\n\n\nOther operations are the same as when operating a single device.\n\n\nOther Batch Operations\n\n\nOther Batch Operations: Move to other group, upgrade, restart, delete.\n\n\n\n\nTemplate Management\n\n\nSave frequently used configurations as templates and quickly apply them when you modify configurations in batches.\n\n\nPS: This feature is only available to business users.\n\n\n\nAdd a Template\n\n\nCheck the configuration that needs to be modified and input value.\n\n\n\n\nGive the template a name and description.\n\n\n\n\nTask List\n\n\nAt task list page, it shows the execution result of the configuration template.\n\n\nPS: This feature is only available to business users.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view the execution result of each device and configuration.\n\n\n\n\nBLE MQTT Bridge\n\n\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is widely used for smart home, wearable and IoT sensors. This feature is for GL.iNet BLE gateway, GL-X750 Spitz and GL-S1300 convexa S which has built-in BLE modules. Read \nthis\n to learn how to use them forward your BLE data to the cloud based on MQTT protocol, including GL.iNet GoodCloud and AWS IoT.\n\n\nGoodCloud and VPN\n\n\nIf you enable GoodCloud feature on router and also use it as VPN client, there is something important you need to know.\n\n\nAt default, GoodCloud process use VPN if you enable VPN client(eg. WireGuard, OpenVPN, Shadowsocks), this bring a problem that if you VPN is configured incorrectly, GoodCloud will not work properly. In order to ensure the normal use of GoodCloud, we suggest you to follow the steps below to enable VPN Policies and disable \"Use VPN for all process on the router\". After you've done these steps, GoodCloud precess will not use VPN.\n\n\n\n\nDisable\n\n\nTo stop GoodCloud service, turn it off on router Web Admin Panel. Please follow the steps below. No action needed on the GoodCloud website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter disable Cloud, the interface is like above.",

AWS seems to have good security and privacy protection. Here we will give an example of how to send your data to AWS IoT platform. It is a little complicated but still OK for IT specialist. \n\n\n1. Setting up your AWS IoT environment\n\n\n1) On the \nWelcome to the AWS IoT Console\n page, in the navigation pane, choose \nManage-\nThings\n , then \nRegister a thing\n. \n\n\n\n\n2) On the \nCreating AWS IoT things\n page, choose \nCreate a single thing\n.\n\n\n\n\n3) On the \nCreate a thing\n page, in the \nName\n field, type a name for your thing, such as \nx750\n. Choose \nNext\n.\n\n\n\n\n4) On the \nAdd a certificate for your thing\n page, choose \nCreate certificate\n. This generates an X.509 certificate and key pair.\n\n\n\n\n5) On the \nCertificate created!\n page, download your public and private keys, certificate, and root certificate authority (CA):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose \nDownload\n for your certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose \nDownload\n for your private key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose \nDownload\n for the Amazon root CA. This will display a new web page. Choose \nRSA 2048 bit key: Amazon Root CA 1\n. This opens another web page with the text of the root CA certificate. Copy this text and paste it into a file named \nAmazon_Root_CA_1.pem\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost web browsers save downloaded files into a Downloads directory. You will copy these files to a different directory when you run the sample applications. Choose \nActivate\n to activate the X.509 certificate, and then choose \nAttach a policy\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nRSA 2048 bit key: Amazon Root CA1\n download web page:\n\n\n\n\n6) Active your thing\n\n\nBack to the previous site, click \"\nActivate\n\", then click \"\nDone\n\". \n\n\n\n\n2. Attach Policy\n\n\n1) After you register your thing, you will need to create and attach a new \npolicy\n to the \ncertificate\n.\n\n\n2) Enter a Name for the policy,such as x750_policy, then \nAdvance mode\n\n\n\n\n3) Delete the automatically created policy code, then paste the policy below. \n\n\n{\n  \nVersion\n: \n2012-10-17\n,\n  \nStatement\n: [\n    {\n      \nAction\n: [\n        \niot:Publish\n,\n        \niot:Subscribe\n,\n        \niot:Connect\n,\n        \niot:Receive\n\n      ],\n      \nEffect\n: \nAllow\n,\n      \nResource\n: [\n        \n*\n\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n\n4) \nCreate\n Policy after you pasted policy code. \n\n\n\n\n5) On the left side, Secure --\n Certificates, Select the certificate you just created, Actions\n--\n Attach policy\n\n\n\n\n6) Chose the policy you created(x750_policy) and choose \nAttach\n.\n\n\n\n\n3. Config GL.iNet devices to connect to AWS IoT\n\n\n1) Upload your certificate to the router\n \n\n\nRename the downloaded certificate files :\n\n\nAmazonRootCA1.pem --\n root_CA.crt\n\n\nxxxxxxxxxx.private.pem.key --\n client.key\n\n\nxxxxxxxxxx. certificate.pem.crt --\n client.crt\n\n\nWindows User use \nSSH and WinScp\n to transfer these three certificate files to \n/etc/aws/\n on router,  please create new folder if you cannot find \n/etc/aws/\n.\n\n\nmkdir /etc/aws/\n\n\n\n\n2) Update mqtt package on GL.iNet routers.\n \n\n\nYou can check if your router comes with updated MQTT package. If it is not, please upgrade it if you want to use AWS.\n\n\nDownload the updated \nmqtt package\n, file name is '\ngl-mqtt_3.0.37-1_mips_24kc.ipk\n\u2018\n\n\nUse WinSCP/SSH to transfer the package to /tmp/ , then delete the old package. \n\n\nopkg remove gl-mqtt --force-depends\n\n\n\n\nThen install the package:\n\n\nopkg install gl-mqtt_3.0.37-1_mips_24kc.ipk\n\n\n\n\n3) Setup config file for your router\n\n\nEdit  \n/etc/config/glconfig\n \n\n\nAdd the following code to your \nglconfig\n file.\n\n\nconfig service 'cloud'                                                   \n        option enable '1'                                               \n        option sub_topic '/a1rLNyG2VK5/mqtt_demo/user/get'               \n        option pub_topic '/sys/a1rLNyG2VK5/mqtt_demo/thing/event/property/post' \n        option service_pride '2'                                         \n        option address 'ssl://xxxxxxxxxxxxxx-ats.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:8883'\n        option clientid 'iotconsole-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'   \n        option log '1'\n\n\n\n\nThe sample of glconfig file: \n\n\n\n\nIf you already setup GoodCloud on router before, just add the code at the end of \nconfig service 'cloud'\n\n\n\n\noption log '1'\n\n\n\n\nmust be contained in the config file.\n\n\nNote**\n\n\nThe topic ARN follows this format:\n\n\narn:aws:iot:*your-region*:*your-aws-account*:topic/*\nyour/topic\n*\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\narn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:topic/my/topic\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nThe message broker uses topics to route messages from publishing clients to subscribing clients. The forward slash (/) is used to separate topic hierarchy.\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe do not recommend using personally identifiable information in your topics.\n\n\nThe following table lists the wildcards that can be used in the topic filter when you subscribe.\n\n\nTopic Wildcards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWildcard\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nMust be the last character in the topic to which you are subscribing. Works as a wildcard by matching the current tree and all subtrees. For example, a subscription to \nSensor/#\n receives messages published to \nSensor/\n, \nSensor/temp\n, \nSensor/temp/room1\n, but not the messages published to \nSensor\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nMatches exactly one item in the topic hierarchy. For example, a subscription to \nSensor/+/room1\n receives messages published to \nSensor/temp/room1\n,\nSensor/moisture/room1\n, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4) HTTP: API Endpoints add to router config file\n \n\n\nThe message broker supports clients connecting with the HTTP protocol using a REST API. Clients can publish by sending a POST message to \n*\nAWS IoT Endpoint\n*/topics/*\nurl_encoded_topic_name\n*?qos=1\"\n.\n\n\nAt the left side of AWS IoT, \nManage -\n Things\n\n\n\n\nYou can find your AWT IoT endpoints at \nInteract\n. \n\n\n\n\n5) Connect your devices to AWS IoT Cloud\n\n\nStart connect to AWS Cloud\n\n\n/etc/init.d/gl_mqtt start\n\n\n\n\nRestart the mqtt services if its process is running.\n\n\n/etc/init.d/gl_mqtt restart\n\n\n\n\nCheck mqtt process status\n\n\nps | grep gl_mqtt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. MQTT Communication Testing\n\n\nTest-\nSubscribe to a topic\n\n\nThe subscription and publish topics in glconfig file: \n\n\noption sub_topic '/a1rLNyG2VK5/mqtt_demo/user/get'               \noption pub_topic '/sys/a1rLNyG2VK5/mqtt_demo/thing/event/property/post' \n\n\n\n\nSo the Subscription and Publish topic in AWS IoT Cloud shall be exchanged:\n\n\nSubscription Topic:  '/sys/a1rLNyG2VK5/mqtt_demo/thing/event/property/post' \nPublish topic:  '/a1rLNyG2VK5/mqtt_demo/user/get'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry \nSubscribe to topic\n, a message published by your router will be received in few seconds.\n\n\n\n\nOr \nPublish topic to your router a message\n: \n\n\n\n\nA message published by AWS IoT Cloud will be received on your router in few seconds. \n\n\nlogread\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication and Demo\n\n\nRead BLE Thermal Sensor\n\n\nThe following demo show how to read data from a thermal sensor, pack the data in JSON format and  send to the GoodCloud.\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/sh\n. /usr/share/libubox/jshn.sh\nwhile true\ndo\nsleep 5\nbletool on\nbletool discovery_type 1 1\nbletool discovery 1 1 0 | awk '/0d09536d6172745f426561636f6e02/{print $0; exit}' \n\n/tmp/blesniffer.log\nbletool end_procedure\nadv_data=`awk '{print $1}' /tmp/blesniffer.log`\ndate=`date +\n%Y%m%d%H%M%S\n`\njson_init\njson_add_string \napi\n \n/user/data\n\njson_add_object \ndata\n\njson_add_string \ndate\n \n$date\n\njson_add_string \nadvertising data\n \n$adv_data\n\njson_close_object\njson_close_object\ndata=`json_dump`\nubus call mqtt pub \n$data\n\nrm /tmp/blesniffer.log\ndone",

The forward slash (/) is used to separate topic hierarchy.  Note  We do not recommend using personally identifiable information in your topics.  The following table lists the wildcards that can be used in the topic filter when you subscribe.  Topic Wildcards     Wildcard  Description      #  Must be the last character in the topic to which you are subscribing. Works as a wildcard by matching the current tree and all subtrees. For example, a subscription to  Sensor/#  receives messages published to  Sensor/ ,  Sensor/temp ,  Sensor/temp/room1 , but not the messages published to  Sensor .    +  Matches exactly one item in the topic hierarchy. For example, a subscription to  Sensor/+/room1  receives messages published to  Sensor/temp/room1 , Sensor/moisture/room1 , and so on.     4) HTTP: API Endpoints add to router config file    The message broker supports clients connecting with the HTTP protocol using a REST API. Clients can publish by sending a POST message to  * AWS IoT Endpoint */topics/* url_encoded_topic_name *?qos=1\" .  At the left side of AWS IoT,  Manage -  Things   You can find your AWT IoT endpoints at  Interact .    5) Connect your devices to AWS IoT Cloud  Start connect to AWS Cloud  /etc/init.d/gl_mqtt start  Restart the mqtt services if its process is running.  /etc/init.d/gl_mqtt restart  Check mqtt process status  ps | grep gl_mqtt",

You can use the data for your laptop.\n\n\nUsing your phone as a hotspot directly is easy, but you cannot connect too many devices.\n\n\n\n\nIt is very easy to share your data to GL.iNet mini router using router's control interfaces, but in some phone and carrier network, they limit sharing data directly, so you can try EasyTether.\n\n\nWe will use Android OS and GL mini router to demonstrate the procedure.\n\n\n\n\nStuff you need\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\n1)     Samsung Galaxy S6 with Android OS\n\n\n2)     GL-AR150 mini router (Other models are also OK)\n\n\n3)     4G sim card\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\n1)     WinSCP (\nhttps://winscp.net/eng/download.php\n)\n\n\n\n\n2)     PuTTY (\nhttps://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html\n)\n\n\n\n\n3)     EasyTether driver openssl (\nhttp://www.mobile-stream.com/easytether/drivers.html\n)\n\n\n\n\n     *Note: For MT300N-V2, please choose LEDE.*\n\n\n\n\n\n4)     EasyTether Android App (Search in Google Play Store)\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\nPreparing your router\n\n\n1) Set up the router\n\n\nEnter 192.168.8.1 in your browser and get into the router web interface. Set the password which will be used for OpenWRT later. Next, update your router to the latest firmware.\n\n\n2) Transfer IPK driver package to the router\n\n\ni.\n Find out the chip of your model (for example Atheros 9531, MediaTek MT7620N, etc) from the website. It is because you have to choose the IPK driver package in the EasyTether driver file base on the chip of your router. (For GL router, you can find the information on our website: www.gl-inet.com, and we will also indicate the position of the IPK driver file for our mini router in section iv.):\n\n\n\n\nii.\n Extract the EasyTether driver file. Open WinSCP, choose SCP as the file protocol and enter the information as the figure shown below:\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the following screen once your connection has been established (left-hand side: Your PC, right-hand side: Your router):\n\n\n\n\niii.\n Go to the main folder by clicking this button.\n\n\n\n\nYou will see the directory tree of the router:\n\n\n\n\niv.\n On the left-hand side (Your PC), find the IPK file of your router in EasyTether driver file you have extracted before. On the right-hand side (Your router), open the tmp folder. Lastly, right click the IPK file and choose upload:\n\n\nNote: For Atheros chip, choose 15.05.1\\ar71xx\\generic. For MediaTeck, choose 15.05.1\\ramips\\mt7620. For other chips, please find the similar file name.\n\n\nMT300N \n MT300A: \\15.05.1\\ramips\\mt7620\\ easytether-usb-openssl_0.8.7-1_ramips_24kec.ipk\n\n\nAR150 \n AR300M: \\15.05.1\\ar71xx\\generic\\easytether-usb-openssl_0.8.7-1_ar71xx.ipk\n\n\n\n\n3) Use SSH to install EasyTether driver\n\n\ni.\n Open PuTTY, enter the IP of your router and other information as the figure shown below, then click Open:\n\n\n\n\nii.\n Login by using your username and password of the router (username: root; password: same as the one you need for entering the web interface):\n\n\nNote: The password you entered will not be showed on the screen.\n\n\n\n\niii.\n You can now update the OpenWRT modules (internet connection required) by typing:\n\n\nopkg update\n\n\nHit enter and then it will update automatically.\n\n\nNote: You can skip the update and do it after you have finished tethering.\n\n\niv.\n Install the driver by typing the following command and then hit enter:\n\n\nopkg install /tmp/filename.ipk\n\n\nNote: The filename is the file you uploaded in Procedure A)2.ii.\n\n\nv.\n Type in the following command and hit enter:\n\n\neasytether-usb\n\n\nvi.\n Copy the following command to Putty:\n\n\ncat \n EOF \n /etc/config/network\n\nconfig interface 'wan'\noption ifname 'tap-easytether'\noption proto 'dhcp'\nEOF\n\n\n\n\nNote:  To paste it into Putty, just right click the black screen and then hit enter.\n\n\nvii.\n Type in the following command to reboot your router or unplug the power cable of your router. Afterward, plug in the power cable to turn on the router.\n\n\nreboot -f\n\n\nPreparing your smart phone\n\n\n1) Enable the Developer Options\n\n\ni.\n Go to Setting -\n About Device -\n Software info. Hitting the build number several times and it will announce that you have turn on the Developer Options.\n\n\n\n\nii.\n Go to Setting -\n Developer Options, turn on the Developer Options and also the USB debugging.\n\n\n\n\n2) Start tethering\n\n\ni.\n Open EasyTether App, tick the USB button, it will show \u201cwaiting for connection from the host\u201d. \n\n\n\n\nii.\n Connect your phone to the router via USB cable.

Make sure that you have inserted the SIM card before powering the 4G router on. \n\n\nThis prompt indicates that there is a problem with the contact between SIM card and card slot. You can try the following methods:\n\n\n\n\nIf you inserted the SIM card after the router is powered on, reboot the 4G router or perform a \"Modem Reset\" from the Router's UI.\n\n\nCheck that you have inserted the SIM card in the correct direction.\n\n\nAdd a piece of paper to the non-contact surface of SIM card inside of the SIM slot so that the SIM card is contacting well inside the slot. \n\n\nTry another SIM card.\n\n\nCheck whether the SIM card slot is damaged and contact customer service through the purchase platform.\n\n\n\n\nQ2: SIM card not registered\n\n\n\n\nEnter the AT instruction page and execute the command \nAT+QPRTPARA=3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait for about 30 seconds to check whether the device is registered with the network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome SIM cards need to fill in the correct APN to register the network. In this case, please ignore the prompt information on the page, enter the manual setting page and fill in the correct APN, and click apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome SIM cards needs to fill a correct PIN code to register the network. In this case, please choose set up manually, choose ttyUSB3 and input your pin code. Please note: QMI mode does not work with a PIN code. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get your APN\n\n\nDifferent types of SIM cards  may have different APN settings, so you can check with your local operator for the correct APN settings.\n\n\nQ3: Auto Setup failed\n\n\nAuto Setup will try all the possible methods to build a connection. In case Auto Setup fails to connect, please try manually setting and selecting the appropriate connection protocol.\n\n\n\n\nUse the QMI protocol\n\n\nSelect device as \n/dev/cdc-wdmX\n and fill in the correct \nAPN\n.\n\n\n\n\nUse PPPD dial\n\n\nSelect device as \n/dev/ttyUSBX\n and fill in the correct  \nAPN\n.

This is because the modern smartphone uses a different design which is equipped with much higher grade of modems. For example, Samsung S10 has a Cat 20  modem and iPhone 11 has a Cat 19 modem. They are 6 times faster in specs than a Cat 6 Quectel EP06 modem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to use \nQMI\n or \nQCM\n protocol instead of using ttyUSB mode. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk your carrier to make sure the  \nAPN\nSettings are correct. Some carriers use different APNs which may yield different speed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe signal may not be good. Click Cell Info to check the signal-related parameters, such as RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ,SINR, etc. Please refer to the \nwiki\n for parameter range determination. If the device's signal is poor, try moving the device to another location and check that the antenna is properly connected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBandwidth also affects the rate. For example, when routers were working on Band5, the band5 supported only 10M bandwidth at most, and routers acquired a lower rate.\n\n\nIn LTE mode, the bandwidth of each band is as follows, which is a parameter that 3GPP has already defined, so there is no way to change it.\n\n\n\n\nQ5: EP06 cannot work at 4G+\n\n\nSome customers may encounter the situation that the mobile phone can work in 4G+ mode, but the router using EP06 cannot work in 4G+ mode.
