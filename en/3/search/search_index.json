You can compile a firmware with tons of features and writing data is almost instant.\n\n\nBy adding PCIe interface, a 5G 802.11a/ac addon module can be connected and you can enjoy the wifi speed on a mini router.\n\n\nPerformance\n\n\nBy adding a fast Nand flash, you can feel how the performance is improved compared to a Nor flash router.\n\n\nThe performance comparision between AR300M (nand) with AR150 is below:\n\n\n\n\nIt only takes 6 seconds to upload and process 250 ovpn files. When installing packages to the router, it takes no more than 20% for the time spent than using nor flash, including the time to download resource from the Internet. So everything just happends in seconds.\n\n\nBuilding Firmware\n\n\nThe router has two flash so we have two firmwares. One firmware is installed on the Nor flash and one is installed on the nand flash. The two firmware is independent from each other. The router will always try to boot from the nand flash. If it fails for 3 times it will boot from the Nor flash.\n\n\nBy using two firmwares, businesses can have dual boot options to ensure the system can backup, upgrade and boot without problems.\n\n\nBuilding the generic firmware for nor flash\n\n\nThe simple instructions of building the firmware can be found here: https://github.com/gl-inet/lede-17.01\nYou need to have a Linux machine.

To determine you are using nor flash or nand flash, please check the available space from the UI.\n\n\nControl which firmware you are booting into\n\n\nThere are two methods to control which firmware you can boot.\n\n\nMethod 1: set boot count\n\n\nThe router will always try to boot into the nand firmware. But if it fails for 3 times it will try to boot into the nor firmware. If you want to boot into the nor firmware, you can tell the router that it failed to boot for 3 times already by setting the uboot env. To do so, you can use the following command in a SSH terminal.\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv bootcount 3\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nYou need to do this each time\n if you want to boot into nor firmware, no matter you which firmware you are using. Otherwise after the firmware boot, it will reset \nbootcount\n variable and next boot will always try to boot the nand firmware.\n\n\nMethod 2: using the switch\n\n\nThis is only valid in the new uboot (from Mar 2017).\n\n\nFirst ssh to the router and set uboot env \nboot_dev\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv boot_dev on\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nThen when the router boot, the router will choose which firmware to boot using the hardware switch.\n1. Left side (near the reset button) --\n Nand flash\n2. Right side  --\n Nor flash\n\n\nTo disable using the switch to choose firmware function, clear \nboot_dev\n variable.\n\n\n$ fw_printenv\n$ fw_setenv boot_dev\n$ reboot\n\n\n\n\nDebrick\n\n\nIf you brick your router and it cannot boot, you can try to save it using uboot.\n\n\nUsing uboot web UI\n\n\nFollow \nthis guide\n for a general instruction to get access of uboot web UI.\n\n\nHere is a video guide for entering AR300M uboot failsafe. \n\n\n\nIn some early version of AR300M, the uboot boot very slowly. So be patient when you press and hold the reset button. The LEDs will start to flash around 5 seconds.\n\n\nThere is a bug in AR300M uboot and in some computers the connection will always reset when you upload firmware. Check \nthis post\n to find the discussion. You can either try chaning the MTU or just try another computer.\n\n\nNote\n: If you have an older version of uboot, the webUI will only be able to flash NAND flash. This is fixed in newer versions.\n\n\nNote\n: When flash NAND firmware, only use the firmware with \n.img\n in the name, not the one with \n.rar\n in the name.\n\n\nThe following figure is the web ui of the \nnew\n uboot.\n\n\n\n\nUsing uboot console\n\n\nIf you want to use uboot console, you need to open the case and solder the serial connectors.\n\n\nThen you need to set up a tftp server.\n\n\nin uboot console, the command to flash nor flash is \nrun lf\n to flash nand firmware is \nrun nlf",

That is useful when you are using the router as a \nrepeater\n. As a result, you can have one more LAN port.\n\n\n\n\nPlug the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router. The information of your connection will be shown on the Cable section. DHCP is the default protocol. You can click \nModify\n to change the protocol.\n\n\n\n\nDHCP\n\n\nDHCP is the default and most common protocol. It doesn't require any manual configuration.\n\n\n\n\nStatic\n\n\nStatic is required if your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided a fixed IP address for you or you want to configure the network information such as IP address, Gateway, Netmask manually.\n\n\nThe current settings will be automatically filled once you choose Static. Change it according to your needs and then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\nPPPoE\n\n\nPPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username \n password that you needed when you are creating the Internet connection.\n\n\nUnder PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Repeater\n\n\nUsing Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe.\n\n\nIt works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network.\n\n\nIn Repeater section, click \nScan\n to search for the available wireless networks nearby.\n\n\n\n\nChoose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password.

That is useful when you are using the router as a \nrepeater\n. As a result, you can have one more LAN port.\n\n\n\n\nPlug the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router. The information of your connection will be shown on the Cable section. DHCP is the default protocol. You can click \nModify\n to change the protocol.\n\n\n\n\nDHCP\n\n\nDHCP is the default and most common protocol. It doesn't require any manual configuration.\n\n\n\n\nStatic\n\n\nStatic is required if your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided a fixed IP address for you or you want to configure the network information such as IP address, Gateway, Netmask manually.\n\n\nThe current settings will be automatically filled once you choose Static. Change it according to your needs and then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\nPPPoE\n\n\nPPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username \n password that you needed when you are creating the Internet connection.\n\n\nUnder PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Repeater\n\n\nUsing Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe.\n\n\nIt works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network.\n\n\nIn Repeater section, click \nScan\n to search for the available wireless networks nearby.\n\n\n\n\nChoose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password. You can also enable the \nRemember\n button to save the current chose wireless network. Finally, click \nJoin\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) 3G/4G Modem\n\n\nGL-MiFi has different options of 3G/4G module which you can choose before purchase. If your GL-MiFi has a built-in modem, the 3G/4G modem section will be activated automatically.\n\n\nYou can also connect to the Internet using a USB 3G/4G modem. Insert your SIM card into the USB modem. Plug the USB modem into the USB port of the router. Once it has been detected, you will be able to find several additional options in the drop-down list of \nDevice\n.\n\n\nBe aware that some USB modems work in host-less mode, which have to be configured through \nTethering\n but not 3G/4G modem.\n\n\nIn General, you can set up your 3G/4G modem by the three basic parameters below. Click \nApply\n to connect.\n\n\n\n\nDevice\n: For built-in modem, please choose \n/dev/cdc-wdm0 (qmi)\n or \n/dev/ttyUSB3\n. For USB modem, please try the additional options one by one.\n\n\nService Type\n: indicate the service of your SIM card.\n\n\nAPN\n: Confirm with your SIM card carrier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Settings:\n\n\n\n\nDial Number\n: Generally, it is a default value and you don't need to set it manually. However, if you have this info, please input it.\n\n\nPincode, Username and Password:\n Generally, these are not necessary for an unlocked SIM card. However, if you have a locked SIM card, please consult your service provider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is connected when the IP address of your SIM card shows up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompatible Modems\n\n\nHere is a list of supported modems that we had tested before. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\n\n3G/4G\n\n\nTested\n\n\nTested by\n\n\nComments*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuectel EC20-E, EC20-A, EC20-C\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuectel EC25-E, EC25-A, EC25-V, EC25-C\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuectel UC20-E\n\n\n3G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZTE ME909s-821\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei E1550\n\n\n3G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei E3276\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTP-Link MA260\n\n\n3G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZTE M823\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nArnas Risqianto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZTE MF190\n\n\n3G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nArnas Risqianto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei E3372\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nanonymous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPantech UML290VW (Verizon)\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet/steven\n\n\nQMI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPantech UML295 (Verizon)\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet/steven\n\n\nHost-less\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovatel USB551L (Verizon)\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGL.iNet/steven\n\n\nQMI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerizon U620L (Verizon)\n\n\n4G\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nHost-less\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*QMI: This modem supports QMI mode.

That is useful when you are using the router as a \nrepeater\n. As a result, you can have one more LAN port.\n\n\n\n\nPlug the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router. The information of your connection will be shown on the Cable section. DHCP is the default protocol. You can click \nModify\n to change the protocol.\n\n\n\n\nDHCP\n\n\nDHCP is the default and most common protocol. It doesn't require any manual configuration.\n\n\n\n\nStatic\n\n\nStatic is required if your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided a fixed IP address for you or you want to configure the network information such as IP address, Gateway, Netmask manually.\n\n\nThe current settings will be automatically filled once you choose Static. Change it according to your needs and then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\nPPPoE\n\n\nPPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username \n password that you needed when you are creating the Internet connection.\n\n\nUnder PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click \nApply\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Repeater\n\n\nUsing Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe.\n\n\nIt works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network.\n\n\nIn Repeater section, click \nScan\n to search for the available wireless networks nearby.\n\n\n\n\nChoose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password. You can also enable the \nRemember\n button to save the current chose wireless network. Finally, click \nJoin\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) USB 3G/4G Modem\n\n\nYou can connect to the Internet using a USB 3G/4G modem. Insert your SIM card into the USB modem  Plug the USB modem into the USB port of the router. Once it has been detected, the 3G/4G modem section will be activated and you will be able to set up your USB modem.\n\n\nBe aware that some modems work in host-less mode, which will be configured through \nTethering\n but not 3G/4G modem.\n\n\nClick \nAuto Setup\n to create the connection.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also click \nManual Setup\n to set up manually.\n\n\nIn General, you can set up by the three basic parameters below. Click \nApply\n to connect.\n\n\n\n\nDevice\n: Choose \n/dev/cdc-wdm0\n if your modem supports QMI, otherwise you need to choose \n/dev/ttyUSB\n, which may include several \nttyUSB\n from 0 to 3. You need to choose the correct one based on the modem spec.

The bootloader heavily depends on the hardware so almost every device requires a different bootloader.\n\n\nTo use the bootloader, you have to \nconnect a UART serial connector\n to your device.\n\n\nTaking our Atheros 9331 boards for example, when powered up, uboot will output the following text:\n\n\n*********************************************\n*   U-Boot 1.1.4  (Sep  9 2014, 09:20:16)   *\n*********************************************\n\nAP121 (AR9331) U-Boot for GL.iNet\n\nDRAM:   64 MB DDR 16-bit\nFLASH:  Winbond W25Q128 (16 MB)\nCLOCKS: 400/400/200/33 MHz (CPU/RAM/AHB/SPI)\n\nLED on during eth initialization...\n\nHit any key to stop autobooting:  0\n\n\n\n\nQuickly press any key to stop booting.\n\n\nUboot console\n\n\nUboot is very useful to save your router.

Modify its content and change the TFTP_DIRECTORY to your folder which will contains your files.\n\n\nTFTP_USERNAME=\nTFTP\n\nTFTP_DIRECTORY=\n/tftpboot\n\nTFTP_ADDRESS=\n[::]:69\n\nTFTP_OPTIONS=\n--secure\n\n\n\n\n\nSometime the service cannot be started because network is not available when it starts. Start the service manually.\n\n\nsudo service tftpd-hpa restart\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nDownload service edition of tftpd from http://tftpd32.jounin.net/tftpd32_download.html, then install it.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn off windows firewall, which is the main reason causing tftpd failed to connect.\n\n\n \n\n\nRun tftpd64_SE Admin, choose your tftpd root (in this example D:\\tftp), choose the \"Server interface\" 192.168.1.2 When clients are connecting to this server, you can see them in the status window.\n\n\n \n\n\nCompiling uboot\n\n\nEach device has a different uboot because it is hardware related.\n\n\nGL-AR150, GL.iNet6416, GL-AR300, GL-AR300M\n\n\nFor these models you can use \nPepe2k's\n uboot, you can download the source from github.\n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod.git\n$ cd u-boot_mod\n\n\n\n\nTo compile the source, you need to have a cross complier toolchain. I am using openwrt toolchain. Make modification to the \nMakefile\n.\n\n\nexport BUILD_TOPDIR=$(PWD)\nexport STAGING_DIR=$(BUILD_TOPDIR)/tmp\n\n# **Replace the following line with your real path**\nexport TOOLPATH=$(BUILD_TOPDIR)/../openwrt/staging_dir/toolchain-mips_34kc_gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2/\n\nexport PATH:=$(TOOLPATH)/bin:${PATH}\n\nexport MAKECMD=make --silent --no-print-directory ARCH=mips CROSS_COMPILE=mips-openwrt-linux-uclibc-\n\n# boot delay (time to autostart boot command)\nexport CONFIG_BOOTDELAY=1\n\n\n\n\nNow start to compile the source. For example, for GL.iNet 6416, you can use:\n\n\nmake gl-inet\n\n\n\n\n\nFor GL-AR150, you can do this:\n\n\nmake 8devices_carambola2\n\n\n\n\nFor GL-AR300 and GL-AR300M, we modified the code a lot so please consult us for details.\n\n\nIt should be very quick and finish in minutes. Then you will find \nuboot_for_gl-inet.bin\n in \nbin/\n.\n\n\nGL-AR150 uboot modify as IoT devices\n\n\nIf you connect IoT addon to AR150's UART, which talks to AR150 using serial. When the IoT addon send some data during uboot boot, it may stop the booting process so you never have the router alive. You need to modify the uboot a little bit so that it can succesffuly boot. \n\n\nUse this code from github \nhttps://github.com/domino-team/uboot-domino\n\n\nIn this uboot, you need to type \ngl\n quickly during uboot boot to enter uboot console.\n\n\nMT300A, MT300N, MT750\n\n\nMT series routers use a different uboot and different code.
